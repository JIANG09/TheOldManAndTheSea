This is what we waited for, he thought. So now let us take it. Make him pay for the line, he thought. Make him pay for it.

这就是我们等待的事情，他想。所以现在让我们抓住机会。他把绳子卷走了，让他补偿我，他想。让他补偿我。

> 这正是我们等候着的，他想。现在我们来接受它吧。钓丝被他拖了许多出去，让他付出相当的代价，他想。让他付出相当的代价。
He could not see the fish’s jumps but only heard the breaking of the ocean and the heavy splash as he fell. The speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had always known this would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across the calloused parts and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the fingers.

他没能看见那鱼跳了出来，只是听到他从海里冲出的声音，还有跌落回去的爆裂声。钓丝迅速的往外跑，他的手割破地厉害，不过他总是清楚这总会发生。他试着让  部分，不让钓丝滑到手掌上，也避免割破指头。

> 他没法看见那鱼的跳跃，只听见海洋的迸爆，和他跌下来的时候，那沉重的浪花四溅。钓丝溜得太快，把他的手割伤得很厉害，但是他一直知道这事会发生的，他试着使那割伤的部份正在生老茧的地方，不让那绳子滑到手掌心里或是割伤手指。
If the boy was here he would wet the coils of line, he thought. Yes. If the boy were here. If the boy were here.

要是那孩子在这里，他会把那一卷卷绳子打湿，他想。没错。要是那孩子在这里。要是他在这儿。

> 如果那孩子在这里，他会打湿那一卷卷的绳子，他想。如果那孩子在这里。如果那孩子在这里。

The line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish earn each inch of it. Now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had crushed. Then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet. He was ceding line but more slowly all he time. He worked back to where he could feel with his foot the coils of line that he could not see. There was plenty of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water.

钓丝一直往外溜，但是现在慢了下来，他让这鱼每拖出去一寸钓丝，都要费尽力气。现在他从木板上抬起头，头从被脸颊压碎的那块鱼肉上起来。然后他跪着，缓慢地站起来。他任钓丝往外跑，但是跑地更加缓慢。他挪回到双脚可以碰到那一卷卷绳子的地方，他看不到绳子。还有很多绳子，现在这鱼往水里扯所有的新绳子。

> 钓丝往外跑，往外跑，往外跑，但是现在跑得慢些了，他放出的每一寸钓丝，都得让那鱼付出代价。现在他从那木头上抬起头来，他的面颊把那片鱼压烂了，他从那稀烂的鱼上抬起头来。然后他跪着，然后他缓缓地站起来。他放出绳子去，但是放得越来越慢。他设法挪到一块地方，可以用他的脚触到那一卷卷钓丝--他没法看见那绳子。还有许多绳子在那里，现在这鱼得要把这么些新绳子全都从水里拖过去，新绳子在水里是非常涩滞的。
Yes, he thought. And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I cannot bring him up. He will start circling soon and then I must work on him. I wonder what started him so suddenly? Could it have been hunger that made him desperate, or was he frightened by something in the night? Maybe he suddenly felt fear. But he was such a calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident. It is strange.

是的，他想。现在跳起来十多次，背上的毛囊里充满了空气，他不能游得太深，那样我没法把他拉起来。他马上就要开始打转了，那时我必须好好在他身上干工作一番。我想是什么让他开始地这么突然？难道是饥饿让他难以忍受，或者是夜里的什么东西吓到了他？可能他突然感到害怕。但是他是如此一只冷静强悍的鱼，他看起来如此无畏，如此自信。这很奇怪。

> 是的，他想。而且现在他跳过不止十二次了，他背脊旁边的胞囊装满了空气，他不能够到深海底去，死在那里；我是没法子把他从那里捞起来的。他就快开始转圈子了，那时候我就得来对付他。不知道他为什么忽然这样激动起来？他可会是饿急了，所以不顾前后地冒险起来，还是夜间有什么东西惊吓了他？也许他突然感到恐怖了。可是他是那样一个平静健壮的鱼，他似乎是那样勇敢，有自信心。这很奇怪。

“You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man,” he said. “You’re holding him again but you cannot get line. But soon he has to circle.”

「你最好什么都不怕，有自信心，老头子，」他说。「你又掌控了他，但是钓丝溜了。不过他就快开始转圈子了。」

> 「老头子，你还是顾你自己吧，你也得勇敢，有自信心，」他说。「你没让他挣脱，但是你收不回钓丝来。但是他不久就得要转圈子了。」
The old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and stooped down and scooped up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off of his face. He was afraid that it might nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength. When his face was cleaned he washed his right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watched the first light come before the sunrise. He’s headed almost east, he thought. That means he is tired and going with the current. Soon he will have to circle. Then our true work begins.

现在老人用左手和肩膀拉住那鱼，右手伸到水下捧着水，洗掉脸上压烂的鲯鳅肉。他担心这肉会让他恶心，想吐，耗掉他的力气。他把脸洗干净了，又把右手伸进水里洗了洗，之后右手就一直在盐水里浸着，他望着日出前的第一缕光辉到来了。他现在几乎是向东去了，他想。说明这鱼疲倦了，顺着洋流走。他就快要开始转圈子了。然后我们真正的工作就开始了。

> 老人现在用他的左手和肩膀来来住他，他弯下腰来用右手掬起水来，洗掉他脸上糊着的稀烂的鲯鳅肉。他怕那腥气会使他作呕，他一呕吐，就没力气了。他脸洗干净了，又把右手伸在船边的水里洗了洗，然后就让它泡在那盐水里，同时他注视着日出前天刚刚亮起来的情景。他是差不多朝东走，他想。可见鱼是疲倦了，跟着潮流走。不久他就得转圈子了。然后我们的真正的工作就开始了。
After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and looked at it.

他觉得右手在水里浸得够久了，把手拿出来，看着它。

> 他认为他的右手泡在水里时间够长了，就把它拿出来，朝它看看。
