“I had better re-bait that little line out over the stern,” he said. “If the fish decides to stay another night I will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottle. I don’t think I can get anything but a dolphin here. But if I eat him fresh enough he won’t be bad. I wish a flying fish would come on board tonight. But I have no light to attract them. A flying fish is excellent to eat raw and I would not have to cut him up. I must save all my strength now. Christ, I did not know he was so big.”

「我还是把船尾那条小的钓丝重新装上饵，」他说。「假使这鱼要再呆上一晚上，我还得再吃点，瓶子里的水很少。我觉得这里只能钓到鲯鳅。但是假使吃了足够新鲜的鲯鳅，那也还不错。但愿今晚能钓到一条剑鱼。但是我没有灯光，不能吸引他们游过来。生吃一条剑鱼真不错，不用把他们切成块。现在我得保存身上所有的力气。上帝啊，我真的不知道他尽然这样伟大。」

>「我还是来把船尾那根小钓丝重新装上饵，」他说。「假使这鱼决定再在这里过一夜，我需要再吃点东西，水瓶里的水也剩的不多了。这里除了鲯鳅恐怕钓不着什么东西。但是鲯鳅要是趁新鲜吃，倒也不难吃。或希望今天晚上有一条飞鱼飞到船上来。但是我没有灯光来吸引它们。飞鱼生吃是很好吃的，而且我用不着把他切开。我得要把所有的力气都节省下来。天哪，我没晓得他那么大。」
“I’ll kill him though,” he said. “In all his greatness and his glory.”

「尽管是这样，我还是要杀死他，」他说。「不论他是多么伟大，多么光荣。」

> 「可是我会杀死他的，」他说。「不管他怎样伟大，怎样光荣。」
Although it is unjust, he thought. But I will show him what a man can do and what a man endures.

虽然这样很不公平，他想。但是我要让他看看，一个人到底能做些什么，到底能忍耐到什么地步。

> 当然这是不公平的，他想。但是我要给他看看人有多大能力，人能忍受多少痛苦。
“I told the boy I was a strange old man,” he said.

「我和那孩子说过，我诗歌奇怪的老头子，」他说。

> 「我告诉那孩子我是个奇怪的老人，」他说。
“Now is when I must prove it.”

「现在证明自己的时候来了，」

> 「我要证明这话，现在正是时候。」
The thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing. Now he was proving it again. Each time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing it.

他已经证明了自己有一千次，但是都不算数。现在他又要再一次证明自己。每一次都是新，他这样做的时候，从未想起过去做的事。

> 他过去已经证明过一千遍了，但是都不算数。现在他又重新证明它。每一次都是新的，他从来不想到他过去做的事。

I wish he’d sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he thought. Why are the lions the main thing that is left? Don’t think, old man, he said to himself, Rest gently now against the wood and think of nothing. He is working. Work as little as you can.

但愿他会睡着，我也就可以睡一下，然后梦到狮子，他想。为什么梦里面总是有狮子？别多想了，老头子，他对自己说，现在轻轻地倚着木头休息，什么都别想。这鱼正在劳作。少劳作些吧。

> 但愿他睡觉，那么我也能够睡觉，梦见狮子，他想。为什么现在差不多什么都不梦见了，只剩下狮子？老头子，不要想，他对自己说。轻轻地靠在木头上休息着，什么都不要想。他在那里工作着。你工作得越少越好。
It was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily. But there was an added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man rode gently with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and smoothly.

就要到下午了，小船仍旧慢慢地移动着，很稳定。但是现在东风更用力地拖着小船，老人随着这一小片海面一起轻轻地起起伏伏，他背上背着钓丝，轻易就能感觉到疼痛，平滑的痛感。

> 已经渐渐地到了下午了，小船仍旧缓慢地稳定地移动着。但是现在的东风增加了那条鱼的负担，老人在小小的风浪中轻轻颤动着，绳子压在他背上，那痛楚的感觉也来得悠然而温和。
Once in the afternoon the line started to rise again. But the fish only continued to swim at a slightly higher level. The sun was on the old man’s left arm and shoulder and on his back. So he knew the fish had turned east of north.

下午有一次，钓丝又一次升了上来。但是那鱼只是继续游着，比原来的位置稍微高了一点。太阳晒着老人的左手，肩膀和背部。于是他知道鱼会向东北方游去。

> 下午有一次，钓丝又升上来了。但是这鱼不过是在略微高些的水平上继续游着。太阳晒在老人的左臂左肩和背脊上。所以他知道这鱼是转向东北了。
