Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he thought. Now that it is daylight let him jump so that he'll fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then he cannot go deep to die.

也许假使我将钓丝拉紧一点，这会刺痛他，他就会跳起来，他想。现在天亮了，让他跳起来，空气填满脊骨边上的胞囊，他就无法回到深水里去死在那里。 

He tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it. I must not jerk it ever, he thought. Each jerk widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw it. Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not-have to look into it.

他试着拉紧钓丝，但是自从钩着这鱼，钓丝已经拉紧到快要绷断了，他身子后仰拉绳子，感到绳子很粗糙，他知道不能再拉紧了。我不能用力拉，他想。每次拉紧一点，钩子划破的口子就裂开一些，他跳起来的时候，可能会甩掉钩子。不管怎样，太阳出来我感觉好些，仅此一次，我可以不用朝着太阳看。

There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added drag and he was pleased. It was the yellow Gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night.

钓丝上裹着黄色水草，但老人知道这样只会增加拖曳的重量，他很高兴。这些是黄色海湾水草，夜晚发出那样多磷光。

"Fish," he said, "I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends.

「鱼，」他说，「我非常爱戴你，尊敬你。但是我必须在今天之内杀掉你。」

Let us hope so, he thought.

我们都但愿如此，他想。

A small bird came toward the skiff from the north. He was a warbler and flying very low over the water. The old
man could see that he was very tired.

北边来的一只小鸟，朝小船飞去。他是一只柳莺，从水面上低低地略过。老人看得出他很疲倦了。

The bird made the stern of the boat and rested there. Then he flew around the old man's head and rested on the
line where he was more comfortable.

小鸟飞到船尾，停在那儿休息着。然后，他在老人的头上转圈子，停在一根钓丝上，那里他觉得更舒服。

"How old are you?" the old man asked the bird. "Is this your first trip?"

「你多大了？」老人问那鸟。「这是你第一次外出吗？」

The bird looked at him when he spoke. He was too tired even to examine the line and he teetered on it as his
delicate feet gripped it fast.

他说话的时候，那鸟望着他。那鸟太疲倦了，都没力气去检查那根钓丝，他在钓丝上摇摇晃晃，那双精巧的爪子紧紧抓住钓丝。

"It's steady," the old man told him. "It's too steady. You shouldn't be that tired after a windless night. What are
birds coming to?"

「站得很稳，」老人告诉他。「太稳了。假使晚上没有风，你本不该那样疲倦。鸟儿飞来作什么？」

The hawks, he thought, that come out to sea to meet them. But he said nothing of this to the bird who could not
understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawks soon enough.

他想，是老鹰飞到海面上来捕捉鸟儿。但他什么也没对鸟儿说，说了它也听不懂，它很快就会见识到老鹰。

"Take a good rest, small bird," he said. "Then go in and take your chance like any man or bird or fish."

「好好休息一下，小鸟，」他说。「然后飞会天上，去碰碰运气，像任何一个人或者一只鸟，或者一条鱼一样。」

It encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly now.

他的背部在晚上绷得僵直，现在真正地痛起来，这让他很想说话。

"Stay at my house if you like, bird," he said. "I am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and take you in with the small
breeze that is rising. But I am with a friend."

「鸟儿，要是你喜欢，就呆在我屋子里吧，」他说。「很抱歉，我不能把帆竖起来，让你站在上面，现在吹着微风。但我要陪一个朋友。」

Just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow and would have pulled him
overboard if he had not braced himself and given some line.

就在那时，那鱼突然耸动了一下，把老人拖倒，一直拖到船头，差点被拖到海里，还好他撑住自己，还放了些钓丝。

The bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him go. He felt the line carefully
with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding.

钓丝猛地抽动的时候，鸟儿飞起来了，老人甚至都没看到他飞走。他用右手仔细地揣度钓丝，发现他的手正在流血。

"Something hurt him then," he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he could turn the fish. But when he
was touching the breaking point he held steady and settled back against the strain of the line.

「什么东西伤到他了，」他自言自语着，把钓丝拉回来，看看能否让那鱼转弯。但是。。。他稳当地的拿着钓丝，坐回来抵住钓丝的压力。

"You're feeling it now, fish," he said. "And so, God knows, am I."

「你现在感觉到钓丝在绷紧了，鱼」他说。「就是这样。上帝知道，我也知道。」

He looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company. The bird was gone.

他向四周望去，想找那鸟，因为他喜欢有它陪伴。那鸟飞走了。

You did not stay long, the man thought. But it is rougher where you are going until you make the shore. How did
I let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made? I must be getting very stupid. Or perhaps I was looking at
the small bird and thinking of him. Now I will pay attention to my work and then I must eat the tuna so that I will
not have a failure of strength.

你并没有停留太久，老人想。但是那你要去的地方更加凶险，直到你抵达海岸才能安全。我如何让鱼用那快速的一拉割破了自己？我一定是变的愚蠢了。或者，也许我正看着那小鸟，正在想着他的事。现在我要集中精力工作，然后，我一定得吃掉那条鲔鱼，吃了才不会没力气。

"I wish the boy were here and that I had some salt," he said aloud.

「我希望那孩子在这里，我还希望有点盐。」他自言自语。

Shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed his hand in the ocean and
held it there, submerged, for more than a minute watching the blood trail away and the steady movement of the
water against his hand as the boat moved.

他把背着的钓丝换到左肩上，跪下来，在海水里仔细地洗了洗手，然后手就放在那，一半没入水里，有超过一分钟，他看着那血液顺着水飘去，小船移动时，海水稳定地打在他手上。

"He has slowed much," he said.

「他慢了许多了，」他说。
