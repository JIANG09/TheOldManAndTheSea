"He‘s found fish," he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of bait fish. But as the old man watched, a small tuna rose in the air, turned and dropped head first into the water. The tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in all directions, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait. They were circling it and driving it.

「他找到鱼了，」他自言自语道。没有飞鱼跳出水面，饵鱼也没有分散开。但是老人正望着，一只小小的鲔鱼跳出来了，翻了个身，头朝下先落入水里。在太阳光下，鲔鱼闪着银光。那一只落入水里之后，一只又一只的鲔鱼跳出了水面，朝着不同的方向跳去，追逐着鱼饵，跳出很长一段。它们绕着鱼饵，追着走。

> 「他找到了鱼了，」他自言自语。没有飞鱼冲破水面，作饵的鱼也并没有被冲散。但是老人正在那里望着，就有一条小鲔鱼跳到空中，翻了个身，头向下，又掉到水里去。那鲔鱼在太阳里银光闪闪，它落下回到水里之后，又有一条接一条全部跳起来，它们四面乱蹦，搅着水，一跳跳得老远地追着那饵。它们包围着它，把它向前推动着。

If they don‘t travel too fast I will get into them, the old man thought, and he watched the school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were forced to the surface in their panic.

如果它们不是前进的这样快，我就可以捉到他们了，老人想。他望着那群把水搅成白色，现在那鸟落了下去，朝着那作饵的鱼落了下去。那群鲔鱼慌成了一片，把饵鱼推到了水面上。

> 假使他们游得不太快，我就可以下手了，老人想，他看着那一群鱼把水都搅白了，那鸟现在飞下来喙食那作饵的鱼，那群鲔鱼在惊恐中把那条鱼挤到水面上来。

"The bird is a great help," the old man said. Just then the stern line came taut under his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and he dropped his oars and felt the weight of the small tuna‘s shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in. The shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side and into the boat. He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering strokes of his neat, fast-moving tail. The old man hit him on the head for kindness and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern.

「这鸟很有用，」老人说。就在那时，感到船尾的钩丝在脚底拉紧了，他把线缠了一个圈，然后搁下了桨，他感到那小鲔鱼的拉了下钩丝，轻轻的一颤的时候，他收紧钩丝，开始把它拖起来。他越往上拉的时候，颤动更强了，他可以看到水下面，那鱼的背是青色的，两边是金色的，然后他拉着那鱼的一边，将鱼拉到了船上。那鱼躺在阳光里的船尾上，眼睛像子弹一样，瞪着那大大的无知的眼睛，那平滑的尾巴，快速的抖动着，击打着船板。老人善意地击了它的头，还踢它，它的身体仍然在抖动着，就在船尾的阴影下面。

>「这鸟非常有用，」老人说。正在这时候，船尾那根钓丝绷紧了--那绳子绕了个圈子踏在他脚底下，所以一踏紧了他就觉得了。他把桨搁下，把钓丝牢牢握着，开始把它拉上来。他可以感觉到那小鲔鱼颤抖的挣扎。他越往上拉，他颤抖得越厉害，他可以在水里看见那条鱼的青色背脊和身体两旁的金色，他随即把他一甩甩过船舷，甩到船里去。他在阳光中躺在船尾，他身体很结实，式样像一颗枪弹，他愚笨的大眼睛瞪视着，同时他那灵巧的，动作迅速的颤抖地很快地敲打着船板，把他最后的一点生命就这样敲掉了。老人由于恻隐之心，在他头上打了一下，然后把他踢到船尾的阴影中，他的身体还在那里震颤着。
