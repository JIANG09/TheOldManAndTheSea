Now, he thought, I must think about the drag. It has its perils and its merits. I may lose so much line that I will lose him, if he makes his effort and the drag made by the oars is in place and the boat loses all her lightness. Her lightness prolongs both our suffering but it is my safety since he has great speed that he has never yet employed. No matter what passes I must gut the dolphin so he does not spoil and eat some of him to be strong.

现在，我得要想增加船的重量，他想。这既有好处，也有坏处，如果他一使劲，那两只桨没有滑脱，还是横在那里，那船就不想从前那么轻了，我可能会放出去许多绳子，结果让他跑了。船轻，我们痛苦地更久，但是我也安全了，因为鱼前进地很快，他至今还没有把本领全部使出来。不管怎么样，我得把鲯鳅的肠子挖出来，否则它要腐烂了，我得要吃一点，长力气。

> 现在，他想，我得要想到增加这船的重量。这有它的危险，也有它的好处。如果他一使劲，而那两只桨没有滑脱，仍旧横担在那里，增加了船的重量，船不像从前那样轻了，我也许被他拉掉许许多多绳子，结果让他跑了。船轻，是延长了我们俩的痛苦，但是使我安全，因为他可以游得非常快，而他至今还没有把本领使出来。无论怎样，反正我总得把这鲯鳅的肠子挖出来，不然要腐烂了，我还得吃一点，长力气。
Now I will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steady before I move back to the stern to do the work and make the decision. In the meantime I can see how he acts and if he shows any changes. The oars are a good trick; but it has reached the time to play for safety. He is much fish still and I saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth and he has kept his mouth tight shut. The punishment of the hook is nothing. The punishment of hunger, and that he is against something that he does not comprehend, is everything. Rest now, old man, and let him work until your next duty comes.

现在我得休息一个多小时，觉得船牢固平稳了，再挪回到船尾去工作，做决定。这段时间，我可以看看他如何行动，看看他是否有变化。这两把桨是一个好计策，但是现在是求安全的时候。他是相当厉害的鱼，我看到他将鱼钩衔在嘴里一处，他将嘴紧紧闭着。钩子的惩罚对他来说不算什么。饥饿的惩罚，以及他在对抗他并不了解的东西，这才是惩罚的一切。休息吧，老头子，让这鱼劳作吧，知道你开始下一个任务。

> 现在我再来休息一个钟头，觉得他踏实了，稳定了，我再挪到船尾去做这工作，并且决定一切。在这时间内我可以看他怎样行动，看他可有什么变化。那将是一个好计策；但是现在已经到了时候，应当为安全着想了。他仍旧是个相当厉害的鱼，我看见那钩子在他嘴角上，他把嘴闭得紧紧的。钩子钩在嘴里的痛苦是不算什么。饥饿的痛苦，加上还得对抗他所不了解的一样东西，这是够他受的。老头子，你现在休息吧，让他工作着，你等你下次再有什么任务的时候再去工作。
He rested for what he believed to be two hours. The moon did not rise now until late and he had no way of judging the time. Nor was he really resting except comparatively. He was still bearing the pull of the fish across his shoulders but he placed his left hand on the gunwale of the bow and confided more and more of the resistance to the fish to the skiff itself.

他觉得自己休息了两个小时。月亮现在还没有升起来，还要再晚一点，他没有判断时间的办法。他没有真地休息，只是跟刚才比放松了一点。他肩上仍旧背着绳子，忍受着鱼的拖曳，但是他的左手拉着船缘

> 他估计着他休息了大概有两个钟头。现在月亮要到很晚才升上来，他无法判断时间。他也并不是真的休息着，不过是比较好些就是。他仍旧把鱼的压力背在肩膀上，但是他把他的左手搁在前面的船舷上，把鱼的抗拒的力量渐渐地大部分都交托给那小船了。
How simple it would be if I could make the line fast, he thought. But with one small lurch he could break it. I must cushion the pull of the line with my body and at all times be ready to give line with both hands.

要是我收紧绳子，事情会变得很简单，他想。但是只要轻轻一歪，绳子就会断。我得用身体来缓冲紧绷的绳子，时刻准备好双手放出更多绳子。

> 只要我能够把这根钓丝拴牢在船上，那多么简单呀，他想。但是他稍微歪一歪就可以把绳子绷断了。我一定得要用我的身体去垫着这钓丝，随时准备着用两只手把钓丝放出去。
 “But you have not slept yet, old man,” he said aloud. “It is half a day and a night and now another day and you have not slept. You must devise a way so that you sleep a little if he is quiet and steady. If you do not sleep you might become unclear in the head.”

「但是你还没有睡觉呢，老头子，」他自言自语。「已经过了半天和一整个夜晚，现在是新的一天了，你还没有睡觉呢。要是这鱼安静稳当，你得想个办法，让自己睡一小会儿。要是你不睡会儿，头脑可能会不清楚。」

> 「可是你还没有睡觉呢，老头子，」他自言自语。「已经有半天和一夜你没有睡觉，现在又是一天了。你一定要想出一个办法，使你可以稍微睡一会，如果他是安静而稳定的话。如果你不睡，也许你会脑筋不清楚起来。」

I’m clear enough in the head, he thought. Too clear. I am as clear as the stars that are my brothers. Still I must sleep. They sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sleeps sometimes on certain days when there is no current and a flat calm.

我脑筋足够清楚，他想。太清楚不过了。我和群星兄弟一样，非常清楚。即便这样，我也得睡觉。星星兄弟要睡觉，月亮和太阳要睡觉，甚至有时候，有那么几天没有潮流，海面平阔，大海也睡觉了。

> 我的脑筋够清楚的，他想。太清楚了。我和星一样清楚，它们是我的兄弟。但是我仍旧得要睡觉，星也睡觉，月亮和太阳都睡觉，就连海洋有时候也睡觉，有那么几天没有潮流，风平浪静的。
But remember to sleep, he thought. Make yourself do it and devise some simple and sure way about the lines. Now go back and prepare the dolphin. It is too dangerous to rig the oars as a drag if you must sleep.

但是记住要睡觉，他想。让自己做到，想个简单信得过的办法来弄钓丝。现在挪回去，准备把鲯鳅的肠子挖出来。如果你得睡觉，用桨来增加船的重量就太危险了。

> 可是你得记着睡觉，他想。叫你自己睡，想出一个简单而可靠的法子管住那根钓丝。现在你到后面去剖开那条鲯鳅。如果你一定要睡觉，就不能够把桨绑起来，增加船的重量，那太危险。
I could go without sleeping, he told himself. But it would be too dangerous.

我可以不睡觉，就这么工作下去，他告诉自己。但是这样太危险了。

> 我可以用不着睡觉，他告诉他自己。但是这太危险了。
He started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees, being careful not to jerk against the fish. He may be half asleep himself, he thought. But I do not want him to rest. He must pull until he dies.

他开始跪着，用手挪回到船尾，很小心，怕惊动了这鱼。这鱼可能半醒半睡着，他想。但是我不想让他休息。他得要拖着船走，直到他死。

> 他开始设法挪到船尾去，用手和膝盖爬行着，小心地避免急遽地拉扯那条鱼。他自己也许也瞌睡得快睡着了，他想。但是我不要他休息。他得要拉曳着直到他死去。
Back in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the strain of the line across his shoulders and drew his knife from its sheath with his right hand. The stars were bright now and he saw the dolphin clearly and he pushed the blade of his knife into his head and drew him out from under the stern. He put one of his feet on the fish and slit him quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower jaw. Then he put his knife down and gutted him with his right hand, scooping him clean and pulling the gills clear.He felt the maw heavy and slippery in his hands and he slit it open. There were two flying fish inside. They were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped the guts and the gills over the stern. They sank leaving a trail of phosphorescence in the water. The dolphin was cold and a leprous gray-white now in the starlight and the old man skinned one side of him while he held his right foot on the fish’s head. Then he turned him over and skinned the other side and cut each side off from the head down to the tail.


回到船尾，他转过身，好让他的左手握着压在肩上的钓丝，然后用右手从刀鞘里抽出刀子。现在星星很明亮，他能清楚地看见鲯鳅，他把刀子戳进它的头，然后又拔出来。他一只脚踏在鱼身上，快速地从鱼尾一直划开到下颌。然后他放下刀，用右手把肠子掏出来，掏干净。他感觉到那胃在他的手中沉而滑，他把它划开。里面有两条飞鱼。他们新鲜，坚硬，他把他们并排放着，把肠子和鰓从船尾扔下水去。他们在水中沉下去，留下一串磷光。鲯鳅是冰凉的，现在在星光下，是灰白色，老人右脚踩着鱼的头，把鱼的一侧剥了皮。然后他把鱼翻过来，把另一侧剥了皮，从鱼头到鱼尾把两侧切下来。

> 他回到船尾，转过身来，让他的左手握住肩上压着的钓丝，用右手把小刀从鞘里拔出来。星光现在很明亮，他清楚地看见那鲯鳅，他把刀锋揿进他头里去，把他从船尾拉出来。他把一只脚踏在那鱼身上，很快地把他剖开，从肝门直剖到下颚的尖端。然后他放下小刀，用右手把肠子挖出来，挖干净了，把鰓也统统拉掉。那胃在他手里拿着，觉得沉重而滑腻，他把他剖开了。有两只飞鱼在里面。它们是新鲜而坚硬的，他把它们并排搁在那里，把肠子与鰓从船尾丢下去。它们沉下去了，在水中留下一缕磷光。那鲯鳅是冷的，现在在星光下看来是一种鳞状的灰白色，老人把他身体的一边剥了皮，右脚踏在鱼头上。然后他把他翻了过来，把另一侧也剥了皮，把他从头到尾剖成两边。
