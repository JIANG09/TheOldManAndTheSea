He slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl in the water. But there was only the light of its slow descent. He turned then and placed the two flying fish inside the two fillets of fish and putting his knife back in its sheath, he worked his way slowly back to the bow. His back was bent with the weight of the line across it and he carried the fish in his right hand.

他把剖开的尸体扔下水去，然后看看水中有没有旋涡。但是只看见尸体缓慢地沉下去。他转过身，把两条飞鱼放进，把小刀插进刀鞘里，他缓慢地挪到船头。他的背上压着钓，右手拿着鱼。

> 他把那尸骨推到水里去，他看了看水里可起了漩涡，但是只有它徐徐下沉的磷光。然后他转过身来，把那两条飞鱼放在他切出的那两块鱼里，把小刀插入鞘中，他又缓缓地设法挪到船头上。他佝偻着，钓丝的重量压在他背上，他右手拿着那鱼。
Back in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish beside them. After that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and held it again with his left hand resting on the gunwale. Then he leaned over the side and washed the flying fish in the water, noting the speed of the water against his hand. His hand was phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he watched the flow of the water against it. The flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his hand against the planking of the skiff, particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern.

他挪回到船头，把两块夹着飞鱼的鱼片放在木头上。他挪了挪肩上背着的钓丝，又用左手握着钓丝，左手倚在船缘上休息着。然后他将身体弯过船缘，在水里冲洗飞鱼，注意着水冲击手的速度。他的手给鱼剖了皮，上面闪着磷光，他望着水流撞击他的手。水流减弱了，正当他用手的一侧在船板上擦着，闪着磷光的颗粒散开了，缓慢地的离船远去。

> 回到船头上来，他把那两块鱼搁在木头上，把飞鱼搁在旁边。此后把肩膀上的钓丝挪了挪，搁在一个新地方，又用他的左手握住它，手搁在船舷上。然后他靠在船边上，把飞鱼在水里洗洗。注意看着水冲激在手上的速度。他的手因为剥了皮，也发出磷光来，他观察着那水流怎样冲到手上，水流可没那么有力了，他把手的一边在船板上揉擦着，一星星的磷质漂浮开来，缓缓地向船尾流去。
“He is tiring or he is resting,” the old man said. “Now let me get through the eating of this dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep.”

「他是累了，要不就是在休息，」老人说。「现在，我得吃了这鲯鳅，然后休息一会，睡一觉。」

> 「他渐渐疲倦了，或者他在那里休息着，」老人说。「现在我来吃掉这鲯鳅，休息一下，睡一会。」
Under the stars and with the night colder all the time he ate half of one of the dolphin fillets and one of the flying fish, gutted and with its head cut off.星空下，一整夜都很冷，他吃了一半块鲯鳅鱼肉，将一条飞鱼剖开，切掉鱼头，然后吃下去。

> 在星光下，夜间越来越寒冷了，他把他切出的两块鲯鳅吃掉了半块，又吃掉一条飞鱼，飞鱼的肠子已经挖掉了，头也切掉了。“What an excellent fish dolphin is to eat cooked,” he said. “And what a miserable fish raw. I will never go in a boat again without salt or limes.”

「要是有配料，鲯鳅吃起来美味极了，」他说。「生吃这鱼，真是悲惨。要是没有盐或柠檬汁，我决不上船打鱼。」

> 「鲯鳅这种鱼煮熟了多么好吃，」他说。「生吃多么难吃。以后倘使欧文不带盐或柠檬，我再也不乘船了。」
If I had brains I would have splashed water on the bow all day and drying, it would have made salt, he thought. But then I did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset. Still it was a lack of preparation. But I have chewed it all well and I am not nauseated.

要是我聪明点，我就应该溅些水花，洒落在船头，一整天都这样做，然后等干了，就能弄些盐出来，他想。不过，直到太阳几乎快落下去，我才钓起这鲯鳅。仍然是我准备不足。但是我嚼着也不错，我也没有觉得想吐。

> 「我如果有脑子的话，我会整天地把水泼在船头上，水干了就有盐了，他想。但是我直到太阳快落山了才钓到这条鲯鳅。究竟是缺少准备。但是我把它完全细细咀嚼过了，倒也没有作呕。」
The sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were gone. It looked now as though he were moving into a great canyon of clouds and the wind had dropped.

天上的云移到东面去了，他认识的那些星，一个接着一个，都消失了。现在看起来，似乎他到了一个云朵峡谷，海面上起了风。

> 东面的天空起了很多云，他所认识的星一个一个全不见了。现在看上去仿佛他驶进了一个巨大的云的峡谷，风急了。
“There will be bad weather in three or four days,” he said. “But not tonight and not tomorrow. Rig now to get some sleep, old man, while the fish is calm and steady.”

「再过三天或者四天，坏天气就该来了，」他说。「但是今天和明天不会来。现在睡一觉，老头子，正好这鱼安静平稳。」

> 「三四天内天气要变坏，」他说，「但是不会是今天晚上或是明天。老头子，你现在来布置一下，想法子睡一会，趁着这时候这鱼是平静稳定的。」
He held the line tight in his right hand and then pushed his thigh against his right hand as he leaned all his weight against the wood of the bow. Then he passed the line a little lower on his shoulders and braced his left hand on it.

他右手紧紧地握着钓丝，将大腿抵住右手，整个身体靠着船头的木头。然后他将肩上的钓丝拉低了一些，把左手压在上面。

> 他把钓丝紧紧地握在右手里，然后把大腿抵着右手，把全身的重量都靠在船头的木头上。然后他把那钓丝在肩膀上移下一点，缠缚在左手上。

My right hand can hold it as long as it is braced, he thought If it relaxes in sleep my left hand will wake me as the line goes out. It is hard on the right hand. But he is used to punishment Even if I sleep twenty minutes or a half an hour it is good. He lay forward cramping himself against the line with all of his body, putting all his weight onto his right band, and he was asleep.

只要缠缚着这钓丝，我的右手就能握住它，他想。要是睡着的时候钓丝松开了，开始往外跑，我的左手能感觉到，让我惊醒过来。右手上的负担太重了。但是他已经习惯了受苦。就算我睡上20分钟，或者半个小时，也是好的。他向前躺下，用整个身体抵着绳子，将他全身的重量都压在右手上，然后睡着了。

> 只要那钓丝是缠缚住了，我的右手总握得住它，他想。如果我睡觉的时候右手松开了，钓丝一往外跑，我的左手就会把我弄醒。右手很吃力，但是他是吃惯了苦的。即使我只睡二十分钟或者半个钟头，也是好的。他向前扑着，用全身去夹紧了那钓丝，将他所有的重量都搁在右手上，于是他睡熟了。
He did not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porpoises that stretched for eight or ten miles and it was in the time of their mating and they would leap high into the air and return into the same hole they had made in the water when they leaped.

他没有梦见狮子，但是梦见了一大群海鸥，队伍有8英里或者10英里那么长，正值繁殖的时节，他们可以高高地跳到空中，然后钻回原来跳出水面的洞里。

> 他没有梦见狮子，却梦见一大群海鸥，队伍有八英里或十英里长，正是它们配对的季节，它们高高地跳到空中，跳起来的时候水里留下一个洞，然后它们又回到这洞里来。
Then he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a norther and he was very cold and his right arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of a pillow.

然后他梦见他在村子里，躺在他的床上，刮着北风，他冷极了，他的右手已经没了知觉，因为他的头没有靠在枕头上，而是枕在右手上休息。

> 然后他梦见他在村庄里，睡在他的床上，刮着北风，他非常冷，他的右臂麻木了，因为他的头枕在手臂上而不是枕头上。
After that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the lions come down onto it in the early dark and then the other lions came and he rested his chin on the wood of the bows where the ship lay anchored with the evening off-shore breeze and he waited to see if there would be more lions and he was happy.

之后，他开始梦见长长的黄色海滩，天开始黑，他看见第一只狮子来到海滩上，然后其他狮子也来了，他把他的下巴放在船头的木板上，船抛了锚，晚上有微风从岸上吹来，他等待着，想看看会不会有更多的狮子，他高兴起来。

> 在这以后，他开始梦见那长长的黄色海滩，他看见第一只狮子在黄昏里下来到海滩上，然后其余的狮子也来了，他把他的下颚搁在船头的木头上，船停泊在那里，夜晚有微风从岸上吹来，他等着看还有更多的狮子，他很快乐。

The moon had been up for a long time but he slept on and the fish pulled on steadily and the boat moved into the tunnel of clouds.

月亮出来很久了，但是他仍旧在熟睡，那鱼平稳地拖曳着船，小船仿佛驶进了云的隧道。

> 月亮上来已经很久了，但是他继续睡下去，那鱼稳定地拉曳着，船驶入云的峡谷。

He woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning out through his right hand. He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could with his right and the line rushed out. Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line and now it burned his back and his left hand, and his left hand was taking all the strain and cutting badly. He looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly. 

他右手握着的钓丝猛地一拉，绷到他的脸上，他醒了过来，钓丝从他的右手飞快地往外跑，右手像灼伤了一样。他的左手没有任何感觉，但是他的右手用尽力气用拉住钓丝，钓丝还是猛地往外跑。终于他的左手摸到了钓丝，他身体后仰，维持平衡，现在灼伤了他的背和左手，所有压力都在左手上，左手严重割破了，他回头看着那一卷卷绳子，他们平滑的溜出去。

> 他醒了，右手的拳头跳起来撞到他脸上，钓丝像火烧似地从他的右手里溜出去消失了。他的左手没有什么知觉，但是他尽可能的用右手阻止那钓丝，钓丝仍旧往外跑。他的左手终于找到那钓丝，他仰着身子把钓丝往后拖，现在它烧灼着他的背脊和左手，他的左手承受了所有的重量。割伤得很厉害。他回过头去看看那一卷卷的钓丝，那绳子平滑地溜出去。

Just then the fish jumped making a great bursting of the ocean and then a heavy fall. Then he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to breaking point and raising it to breaking point again and again. He had been pulled down tight onto the bow and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move.

就在那时，那鱼跳了起来，海面顿时爆裂开，然后又重重地落下去。然后他一次又一次的跳出来，小船快速地向前，尽管绳子仍然往外跑，老人拉紧绳子，就快到断裂点了，一次又一次的拉紧绳子，接近断裂点。他被重重地拉倒在船头上，他的脸压在切下的鲯鳅块上，他动不了了。

> 正在这时候，那鱼跳起来了，**海洋大大地爆裂开来**，然后他沉重地跌下去。然后他又一次次地跳起来，船走得飞快，然而钓丝也仍旧向外飞跑，老人将压力提高到迸断的程度，他一次次地将它提高到迸断的程度。他被紧紧地往下拉，俯倒在船头上，他的脸正压在切开的一块鲯鳅上，而他没法动弹。


金句：海洋大大地爆裂开来
