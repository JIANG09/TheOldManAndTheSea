"Eat it a little more," he said. "Eat it well."

「再吃一点吧，」他说。「好好地吃。」

Eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you, he thought. Come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you. All right. Are you ready? Have you been long enough at table?

吃饵吧，好让那钩子的尖进入你的心，然后要了你的命。轻轻松松地来吧，我好用鱼叉对付你。好的。你准备好了吗？

>  把它吃下去，让那钩子的尖端戳到你心里去，杀死你，他想。乖乖地浮上来，让我把鱼叉戳到你身上。好吧。你准备好了吗？你这顿饭吃得时间够长了吗？

"Now! he said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard of line and then struck again and again, swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and the pivoted weight of his body.

「现在！」他自言自语，他的双手重重地打下去，拉回一码长的钓丝，然后一次又一次的打下去，轮流甩着两只手拉着绳索，两只胳膊使出了所有的劲，把整个身体的重量都倚上去。

> 「现在！」他自言自语，他两只手一齐来，重重地打下去，收进一码钓丝，然后他两只手臂轮流甩着，一次一次打在绳子上，用尽手臂的力量，把身体的重量也倚在上面。

Nothing happened. The fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise him an inch. His line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his back until it was so taut that beads of water were jumping from it. Then it began to make a slow hissing sound in the water and he still held it, bracing himself against the thwart and leaning back against the pull. The boat began to move slowly off toward the north-west.

什么都没有发生。那鱼慢慢地游走了，老人无法把他提起一尺。他的钓丝很结实，专门用来捉大鱼，他把钓丝背在背上，拉的那样紧，甚至有水珠从绳子里跳出来。然后那绳子在水面开始发出一中缓慢的嘶嘶声，他仍然拿着绳子，绷紧身体抵着横梁，身体向后仰着，那鱼要往外拉。小船开始慢慢地向西北移动。

> 一点用也没有。那鱼仅只缓缓地游开去，老人无法把他提起一寸。他的钓丝很结实，是专为捕捉大鱼而制的，他把那绳子背在背上，拉得那样紧，甚至有水珠从绳子里跳出来。然后那绳子开始在水中发出一种迟缓的嘶嘶声，老人仍旧握着它，他振作精神靠在座板上，身子向后仰着，预料那鱼要往外拉。船开始缓缓地移动起来，向西北驶去。

The fish moved steadily and they traveled slowly on the calm water. The other baits were still in the water but there was nothing to be done.

那鱼平稳地移动，他们在平静的水面上缓慢地移动着。其他的饵仍然在水里，但是什么也做不了。

>  那鱼平稳地移动着，它们在平静的水中缓缓航行。别的钓饵仍旧在水里，但是也不能够把它们怎么样。

"I wish I had the boy," the old man said aloud. "I‘m being towed by a fish and I‘m the towing bitt. I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I must hold him all I can and give him line when he must have it. Thank God he is traveling and not going down."

「要是那孩子在就好了，」老人自言自语。「我一直被这鱼拖着走，我也要拖着他走。我可以把钓丝弄紧些。但是他可能会把钓丝咬断。我必须告让他知道我的能耐，当他必需吃饵的时候，再给他钓丝。感谢上帝，他正在游动，他没有沉下去。」

> 「但愿我有那孩子在这里，」老人自言自语。「这条鱼像拉纤似地把我这船拉着走，我就是拴纤的短柱。我可以使屌钓丝固定，使他拉不动。但是他可以把它挣断。我一定要尽我最大的力量不让他跑掉，他挣扎得厉害的时候我就把绳子放长些。幸而他只是航行，并没有往下面去 ---感谢上帝。」

What I will do if he decides to go down, I don‘t know. What I‘ll do if he sounds and dies I don‘t now. But I‘ll do something. There are plenty of things I can do.

要是他向下游，我要怎么办呢，我不知道。要是他死了，我要做什么呢，我不知道。但是我要做点什么。有很多事情我可以做的。

> 假使他决定往下面去，我怎么办呢？我不知道。假使他潜入海底，死了，我怎么办呢？我不知道。但是我会想办法的。我能做的事情很多。

He held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff moving steadily to the north-west.

他把钓丝背在背上，看着它在水里倾斜着，小船平稳的移动着，向西北去了。

> 他把钓丝背在背上，注视着那绳子在水中的斜度小船稳定地向西北移动着。

This will kill him, the old man thought. He can‘t do this forever. But four hours later the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing the skiff, and the old man was still braced solidly with the line across his back.

这样会杀死他的，老人想。他不能永远这么做。但是四个小时过后，鱼仍旧会稳稳地游到有水面上，拖曳着小船，老人仍然会结结实实地靠在座板上，背上背着绳子。

> 老人想，这条鱼要累死了。他不能永远这样下去。但是四个小时后，那鱼仍旧稳定地向海外游去，拖着那条小船，老人仍旧背上背着钓丝，那绳子结结实实地绷在他身上。
>
"It was noon when I hooked him," he said. "And I have never seen him."

「我钩住他的时候是中午了，」他说，「但是我没见过他。」

> 「我正午钓到他的，」老人说。「而我到现在还一次都没看见过他。」
