They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat.

他们把用具从船上拾起来。老人把船桅扛在肩上，男孩拿着木盒，里面装着盘绕的一卷卷编织牢实的棕色钩丝，鱼叉，鱼钩还有鱼钩的柄。船尾是装着鱼饵的盒子，旁边是制服大鱼的木棒。没人会偷老人的东西，但最好还是把帆和沉沉的丝线拿回去，因为露水对这些物件不好。尽管老人确信当地人不会偷他的东西，他想鱼钩和鱼叉留在船上，是没必要的诱惑。

They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its open door. The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.

他们一起沿着路走上去，走到老人的小屋，屋子门开着，他们走了进去。老人把帆裹着的桅杆斜倚着墙，孩子把箱子和其他工具放在桅杆旁。桅杆几乎有屋子一面墙那么长。屋子是由一种棕树结实的嫩叶做成的，里面放着一张床，一张桌子，一把椅子，泥地上有一处可以用木炭烧饭。嫩叶纤维粗厚，重重叠叠，压平整，搭起棕色的墙。墙上挂着耶稣圣心彩画，还有一副考伯来处女图。这些都是他妻子的遗物。以前墙上还挂着他妻子的彩色照片，但他取下来了，因为他太孤独，不敢看。那照片放在墙角的架子上，在他的干净衬衫下面。
