He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.

这是一个老头子，一个人在在墨西哥湾捕鱼。已经过去了48天了，他一条鱼都没捕到。刚开始40天里，一个男孩子和他一起捕鱼。但是40天都没捕到鱼，男孩的的父母命令男孩离开老人，说老人绝对是厄运至极，男孩随着另一条船捕鱼，第一周就捕到3条大鱼。老人每天都空船而归，男孩看到了着实伤心，他经常去帮老人拉螺旋绳、或是拿鱼叉，并且把船上桅杆得的帆收拢。船帆用面粉袋打了补丁，然后收拢了起来，看上去就像一面标志着永远失败的旗帜。

他是一个老头子，一个人划着一只小船在墨西哥湾大海流打鱼，而他已经有八十四天没有捕到一条鱼了。在最初的四十天里有一个男孩子和他在一起。但是四十天没捕到一条鱼，那男孩的父母就告诉他说这老头子确实一定是晦气星--那是一种最最走霉运的人--于是孩子听了父母的吩咐，到另一条船上去打鱼，那只船第一个星期就捕到3条好鱼。孩子看见老人每天驾着空船回来，心里觉得很难过，他总去帮他拿那一卷卷的钩丝，或是鱼钩和鱼叉，还有那卷在桅杆上的帆。帆上用面粉袋打着补丁，卷起来的时候，看上去像永久的失败的旗帜。

The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.

老人身材纤瘦，面容憔悴，背后脖颈上有深深地皱纹。他的脸颊上有棕色的斑痕，那是良性的皮肤癌，热带海面的太阳光线反射导致的。斑痕一路跑满了老人两边脸颊。老人经常用绳索拉动大鱼，手上留下了深深折痕的疤，但是都不是刚留下的，像干涸无鱼的沙漠中被侵蚀的地方一样古老。

老人瘦而憔悴，颈后有深的皱纹。面颊上生着棕色的肿起的一块块，那是热带的海上反映的阳光晒出来的一种无害的瘤。顺着两边的脸，全长满了那肿起的一块块。他的手因为拉绳子，拖着沉重的鱼，有纹路很深的创痕。但是没有一个创痕是新的，都是古老的，像一个没有鱼的沙漠里被风沙侵蚀的地层一样。

Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.

他身上的一切都是老旧的，除了眼睛，眼睛是大海的颜色，奕奕有神，永不言败。　

> 他身上的一切全是老的，除了他的眼睛，眼睛和大海一个颜色，很愉快，没有战败过。

“Santiago,“ the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.

圣地亚哥。男孩子一边说，一边和老人一起拖船上岸。“我又可以和你捕鱼了。我们赚到些钱了。”

>“山蒂挨戈，” 那孩子对他说，他们把小船拖到岸上，正从那里爬上去，“我又可以和你一起同去了。我们赚了点钱。”

　　
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.

老人教男孩如何捕鱼，男孩很爱老人。

>老人教了这孩子怎样打鱼，孩子爱他。

　　
“No,“ the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.“

不，老人说，你跟着这只幸运垂青的船。和他们呆在一起。

> “不”，老人说。“你现在这条船运气好。你跟着他们吧。”

“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks.“
但是你记不记得，你出海87天，一条鱼都没不到；我们这三周，每天都能捕到大鱼。

> “但是你记得有一次你八十七天没打到鱼，然后我们接连三个星期，天天捉到大鱼。”

　
“I remember,“ the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.“
我记得。老人说，你没离开我，是因为你有疑问。这些我都知道。　　

>“我记得，”老人说。“我知道你不是因为疑心我运气坏所以离开了我。”　　

“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.“
是爸爸要我离开。我是他的儿子，只能听他的。　

>“是爸爸叫我走的。我是一个小孩，我得要听他的话。”

　　
“I know,“ the old man said. “It is quite normal.“
我知道，老人说，这太正常不过了。

>“我知道，”老人说。“这是很正常的。”　

“He hasn’t much faith.“
他信念不足。　

>“他没有多少信心。”


“No,“ the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?“
是啊。老人所，但是我们有信念，不是吗？　

> “他没有，”老人说。“可是我们有。是不是？”

　　
“Yes,“ the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff home.“
是的。男孩说，我给你买杯啤酒，然后我们把东西弄回家，怎么样？


> “是的，”孩子说。“我请你到露天酒店吃杯啤酒，行不行，然后我们把东西 拿回去。”

　　
“Why not?“ the old man said. “Between fishermen.“

何乐而不为呢？老人说，和捕鱼人们一起喝酒。

> “有什么不行呢？” 老人说。 “大家都是渔夫。”

They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.

他们坐在露天酒店里，好多渔夫拿老人逗乐子取笑，老人并没有生气。其他一些年长的渔夫，难过的看着老人，不过他们没有外露出来，只是礼貌的聊着洋流、垂钓的深度、平稳的好天气以及他们的见闻。成功捕鱼而归的渔夫已经进来了，把捕杀的青枪鱼整只的平放在两个厚木板上，木板每一端都有人抬着，歪歪斜斜的抬到鱼房里，在那里等着冰卡车运到哈瓦那的市场去。有人捕到鲨鱼，运到小海湾一侧的鲨鱼工厂里，用滑车吊着，取了肝脏，砍了鳍，剥掉鱼，肉切成一条一条的，撒上盐。

> #### 张爱玲的翻译
他们在露台上坐着，许多渔夫都取笑老人，他并不生气。另有些年纪大些的鱼人向他看看，觉得很难过。但是他们并不露出来，他们很客气地谈论着那潮流与他们垂钓的深度，还有这一向天气一直这样好，还有他们的见闻。今天收获好的渔人都已经回来了，把他们的马林鱼宰杀了，把鱼平放在两块木板上，一头一个人抬着，蹒跚的走到鱼房里，在那里等着冰车把鱼运到哈瓦那的市场去。捉到鲨鱼的人把它们送到小海湾另一边的鲨鱼厂去，用滑车把它们吊起来，把肝拿掉，鳍割掉，皮剥掉，肉切成一条条准备腌。

---

When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.

鲨鱼厂的味道随着东风越过海湾飘了过来；但今天，只有微弱的一点点味道，因为风向着北面吹去，然后停住了，露台上阳光宜人。

> 东面有风来的时候，有一股气味从海港那一边的鲨鱼厂里吹过来。但是今天只有微微的一点气味，因为转了北风，然后风息了，露台上很愉快，晒着太阳。


“山蒂埃戈，” 孩子说。


“Yes,“ the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.


“嗳，” 老人说。他手握酒杯，正想着好多年前的事。

　　
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?“


“我去弄点沙丁鱼，给你明天用罢？”

　　
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.“

　　
“不用了。去打棒球吧。我还能划船，罗格略会帮我撒网。”

　　
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you, I would like to serve in some way.“


“我很想去。如果不能和你一起捕鱼，我想多少帮你做点事。”


> 我很想去，如果我不能够跟你一块儿打鱼，我想给你做点什么别的事。


“You bought me a beer,“ the old man said. “You are already a man.“


“你请我吃了杯啤酒，”老人说。“你已经是个大人啦。”

　　
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?“


“第一回跟你捕鱼，我有多大？”


> 你第一次带我到船上去的时候，我几岁?


“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?“

　　
“你五岁。有一次我把一条鱼拖上船，它胡蹦乱跳，差一点把船弄散架，你差一点送了命。还记得吗？”


> 五岁。你差一点送了命，那天还没到时候，我就把鱼拖上来，他差点把船弄碎，你记得吗？


“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweat blood smell all over me.“

　　
“我记得，它的尾巴使劲拍打着，撞击着，船的横梁断了，棍棒敲击的声音。我还记得你把我扔到船头盘绕的钩丝那，感觉整条船都在颤抖，你敲击那鱼，就像在劈砍一棵树，我周围都是血汗味。”


> 我记得那尾巴拍拍砰砰的打着，划船人的座位也破了，还有你用木棒打他的声音。我记得你把我丢到船头去，那儿堆着湿淋淋的一卷卷的钩丝，我可以觉得整个船在那里抖，还有你用木棒打他的声音，就像砍树一样，我混身都是那甜甜的血腥气。

“Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?“

　　
“你真的记得这些么，还是我告诉你的？”

　　
“I remember everything from when we first went together.“

　　
“自从我们第一次一块儿出去，样样我都记得。”
　　
The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.
