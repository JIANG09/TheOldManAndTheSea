He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains. He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it. He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning.

他很快就睡着了，梦见非洲，那时自己还是个孩子，有那狭长的金色海岸，有白色沙滩，白的耀眼，还有高耸的海岬，巨大的棕色山脉。他现在每晚都生活在海岸边，梦中，他听到海浪的咆哮，看到当地渔船穿越浪峰。他闻到焦油和油麻丝的味道，还有早晨微风滑过陆地，带来了非洲的气息。

> 他很快就睡熟了，他梦见非洲，当他还是个孩子的时候；还有些长长的金色的海滩，和那白色的海滩，白的耀眼，和那崇高的海岬，和棕色的大山。他现在天天晚上住在那海岸上，在他的梦里他听见海涛的吼声，看见土人的小船破浪而来。他睡梦中嗅到甲板上焦油和碎绳的气味，他也嗅到非洲的气味，早晨陆地上吹来的风带来的。

Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising fro m the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbors and road-steads of the Canary Islands.

平时，他闻到陆地上微风的气息，就醒来，穿上衣服，叫醒孩子。但今晚，陆地上的微风很早就吹来，梦里，他知道时间还早，继续做梦，看见了海边岛屿上耸立着白色山峰，然后梦见不同的海港，还有加纳利群岛的泊船处。

> 他通常都是

He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he l loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy. He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing.

他不再梦见暴风雨，不再梦见女人，不再梦见伟大的际遇，或大鱼，或争斗，或角力，也不再梦见他的妻。他只梦见现在的地方和海滩上的狮子。薄暮里，狮子像小猫一样玩耍，他爱他们，就像他爱孩子一样。他从没梦见过孩子。他醒了，透过开着的门看到月亮，他展开长袴，穿上。他在小屋外撒尿，然后顺着路走上去，叫醒孩子。早上清冷，他打了个寒颤。但是他知道打几个寒颤就暖和了，马上他就要划船了。

The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him. The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on.

孩子住的房子门没锁，他打开门，赤着脚轻轻走进去。孩子睡在第一间房里的小床上，借着消褪的月光，老人能清楚地看到孩子。他把手轻放在孩子的腿上，直到孩子醒来，转过头看着他。老人点点头，孩子从床尾的椅子上拿起他的袴子，坐在床边，穿起来。

The old man went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, “I am sorry.“

老人走出门，孩子跟在他身后。孩子很困倦，老人把手放到他的肩膀上，说：“对不起。”

“Que va,“ the boy said. “It is what a man must do.“

“哪里的话，” 孩子说。“男子汉就得这么做。”

They walked down the road to the old man’s shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats.

他们沿着路走下去，走去老人的小屋。一路上，在黑暗中，赤着脚的俩人就这么走着，扛着船上的桅杆。

When they reached the old man’s shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.

他们到了老人的小屋时，孩子拿起篮子里的钩丝，鱼叉还有鱼钩，老人把裹着帆的桅杆扛在肩上。

“Do you want coffee?“ the boy asked.

“你想不想喝咖啡？” 孩子问。

“We’ll put the gear in the boat and then get some.“

“我们把东西放到船上，然后再去弄点咖啡。”

They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen.

他们在清早渔夫的服务站，用炼乳罐子喝了咖啡。

“How did you sleep old man?“ the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep.

“老头子，你睡得怎么样？” 孩子问。他现在醒了，虽然完全清醒还有点困难。

“Very well, Manolin,“ the old man said. “I feel confident today.“

“睡的很好，马诺林，” 老人说。“我今天很自信。”

“So do I,“ the boy said. “Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything.“

“我也是，” 孩子说。“现在我给我们弄点沙汀鱼，再给你弄点新鲜的鱼饵。他自己拿东西。他不喜欢任何人拿任何东西。”

“We’re different,“ the old man said. “I let you carry things when you were five years old.“

“我们不一样，” 老人说。“你五岁时，我就让你拿东西了。”

“I know it,“ the boy said. “I’ll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here.“

“我知道，” 孩子说。 “我就回来。再喝一杯咖啡。我们都是有信用的。”

He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored.

他走了，赤脚踩在珊瑚岩上，走到储藏鱼饵的冰屋那儿。

The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.

老人慢慢的喝咖啡。 这一整天，他只有这个果腹，他知道他得喝了。吃饭困扰了他很长时间，他从来不吃午餐。他在船头放了一瓶水，这就是一整天他所需要的。

The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.

孩子回来了，拿着沙丁鱼还有用报纸裹着的两条鱼饵。他们沿着小路走到小船那儿，脚下踩着卵石般细砾的沙子，抬起小船，让它滑行在水面上。

“Good luck old man.“

“老头子，祝你好运。”

“Good luck,“ the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbor in the dark. There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills.

“好运，” 老人说。 他把船桨上的绳索绑在栓上，身子前倾，迎着水面的波峰，在黑暗中驶出了海港。别的船只从其他海港出海，老人听到船桨入水和他们推动船桨的声音，虽然他看不到他们。现在月亮已经落到山下了。
