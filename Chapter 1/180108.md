When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down. The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old man’s shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very old, and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen forward. His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun. The old man’s head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in his face. The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze. He was barefooted.

孩子回来时，老人坐在椅子里睡着了，太阳也落山了。孩子从床上拿了老旧的军毯，盖在椅背上，遮住老人的肩膀。他的肩很奇怪，虽然老了，但强而有力。脖颈也很强壮，老人沉睡时，头前倾低垂，颈上的皱纹不多。他的衬衫和船帆一样，打了很多补丁，在太阳的烤晒下，褪了色，变成不同的形状。老人的头倒是年迈了，他眼睛闭着，脸上毫无生气。他的膝盖上放着报纸，手压在报纸上，光着脚。

> 孩子回来的时候，老人坐在椅上睡熟了，太阳下去了。孩子把床上那条旧军毯拿起来，摊在椅背上，盖住老人的肩膀。是奇异的肩膀。虽然非常老了，仍旧壮健，颈项也强壮，老人睡熟的时候头向前倾，颈上的皱纹就没有那样明显。他的衬衫已经补过这么许多次，简直和那帆差不多了，补丁被太阳晒得褪成各种不同的颜色。但是老人的头部是非常衰老的，眼睛以闭着，脸上就没有生命。报纸摊在他的膝盖上，他的手臂把它压牢在那里，不被晚风吹去。他赤着脚。

The boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep.

孩子让老人在那睡着，离开了一会，他回来时，老人还在沉睡。

 > 孩子把他留在那里，他再回来的时候，老人还在睡着。

“Wake up old man,“ the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man’s knees.

“醒醒吧，老人家，“ 孩子说着，一只手放在老人的膝盖上。

> “老头子醒醒吧，“ 孩子说，他把一只手放在老人的膝盖上。

The old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away. Then he smiled.

老人睁开眼，有那么一刻，像从很远的地方回来一样。接着他笑了。

> 老人张开眼睛，在那一刹那间，他是从很远的地方回来。然后他微笑了。

“What have you got?“ he asked.

“你弄到了什么？“ 他问。

> “你手里拿着什么？“ 他问。

“Supper,“ said the boy. “We’re going to have supper.“

“晚饭，“ 孩子说。“我们要吃晚饭了。“

“I’m not very hungry.“

“我不是很饿”

> 我不太饿。

“Come on and eat. You can’t fish and not eat.“

“来吃吧，你不能光捕鱼，不吃东西啊。“

> 你不能打鱼而不吃饭。
