“I have,“ the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it.

“我做过这种事，” 老人说着，站起来，把报纸折好。

> “我试过了，” 老人说，一面站起来，拿起报纸把它折叠起来。

Then he started to fold the blanket.

接着他开始叠毯子。

“Keep the blanket around you,“ the boy said. “You’ll not fish without eating while I’m alive.“

“披着毯子吧。” 孩子说。“只要我活着，你不能不吃饭就去打鱼。”

> “你还是把毯子围在身上吧。” 孩子说。“只要我活在世上一天，决不让你打鱼不吃饭。”

“Then live a long time and take care of yourself,“ the old man said. “What are we eating?“

“那你要活很久，还得照顾好自己，” 老人说。“我们要吃什么？”

> “那么你活得长长的，好好当心你自己，”

“Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew.“

“黑豆和米饭，煎香蕉，还有炖肉。”

The boy had brought them in a two-decker metal container from the Terrace. The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin wrapped around each set.

孩子从露天酒店借来个两层的金属盒子。兜里装着两套刀、叉子和勺子，每一套都用纸巾包着。

 > 孩子从露台酒店，把饭菜装在一个双层的金属品食盒里带了来。两副刀叉和匙子装在他口袋里，每一副外面裹着一张纸巾。

“Who gave this to you?“

“谁给你的？”

“Martin. The owner.“

“马丁。那老板。”

“I must thank him.“

“我得要谢谢他。”

“I thanked him already,“ the boy said. “You don’t need to thank him.“

“我已经谢过了，” 孩子说。“你不用再谢他。”

> 你用不着去谢他。

“I’ll give him the belly meat of a big fish,“ the old man said. “Has he done this for us more than once?“

“我要给他一块大鱼的肚肉。” 老人说。“他不止一次为我们做这些吧？”

> “我下回把一条大鱼的肚肉给他，” 老人说。“他给我们东西可是已经不止一次了？”

“I think so.“

“我想是的。”

“I must give him something more than the belly meat then. He is very thoughtful for us.“

“这样的话，我必须给他更多，不止鱼肚子肉。他对我们很周到。”

> “那我除了肚肉一定还要多给他一点。他对我们非常体贴。”

“He sent two beers.“

“他还送了两瓶啤酒。”

“I like the beer in cans best.“

“我最喜欢听装的啤酒。”

“I know. But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the bottles.“

“我知道。但这是瓶装的，哈土依啤酒。我把瓶子送回去。”

“That’s very kind of you,“ the old man said. “Should we eat?“

“你真好，” 老人说。“我们该吃了吧？”

“I’ve been asking you to,“ the boy told him gently. “I have not wished to open the container until you were ready.“

“我一直在问你呢，” 孩子温和的说。“等你准备好了，我再打开盒子。”

> “我刚才已经在叫你吃了，” 孩子柔和地告诉他。“我想等你预备好了再把食盒打开。”

“I’m ready now,“ the old man said. “I only needed time to wash.“

“我准备好了，” 老人说。“只要点时间洗洗。”

> “我只需要一点时候洗刷洗刷。”

Where did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply was two streets down the road. I must have water here for him, the boy thought, and soap and a good towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and another blanket.

你上哪儿洗呢？孩子想。村子的水源还要过两条街。我真该为他准备好水，肥皂和一条干净毛巾，孩子想。我怎么这样不周到？我该为他准备过冬的衬衫和夹克，鞋子和毯子。

> 你在那里洗呢？孩子想。村庄里的蓄水，沿着这条路走下去要两条街。我得要给他弄点水在这里，孩子想，还要肥皂和一条好毛巾。我为什么这样粗心？我得要给他另外弄件衬衫，还有一件外衣冬天穿，还有一双随便什么鞋子，和另外一条毯子。

“Your stew is excellent,“ the old man said.

“你这炖肉真不错，” 老人说。

“Tell me about the baseball,“ the boy asked him.

“跟我说说棒球吧，” 孩子问老人。

“In the American League it is the Yankees as I said,“ the old man said happily.

“我总说，美国联盟中，洋基队最厉害，” 老人高兴地说。

> “在美国联赛里就推洋基队了，我早就说过。” 老人快乐的说。

“They lost today,“ the boy told him.

“他们今天输了，” 孩子告诉他。

“That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again.“

“这算不了什么。伟大的迪马里奥风姿依旧。”

>  伟大的狄马奇奥又恢复了往日的雄风。

“They have other men on the team.“

“队里还有其他厉害的球员。”

> 他们这一队里也还有别人。

“Naturally. But he makes the difference. In the other league, between Brooklyn and Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn. But then I think of Dick Sisler and those great drives in the old park.“

“正常。但他是个关键角色。要说其他联队，伯克利队和费城队，我肯定选费城队。但我又想起了迪克西斯勒在老公园打的好球。”

>  那自然啰。可是有了他就两样了。在另外那个联赛里，在布鲁克林和费城两队里面，我宁愿还是要布鲁克林队。可是我又想起狄克西斯勒，在老球场里那样有力的一记记打过去。

“There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever seen.“

“他们无与伦比。我见过用时最长的球，就是他打的。”

“Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace? I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid.“

“他常来露天酒店，你记得吗？我本想带他去捕鱼，但我太胆小，不敢去问他。然后我请你去问他，你也不敢去。”

“I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives.“

“我记得。这是个巨大的错误。他可能回和我们一起去。这是一辈子的回忆。”

“I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing,“ the old man said. “They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand.“

“我想带迪马里奥一起捕鱼，” 老人说。“他们说他的父亲也是个渔人。或许他和我们一样贫困，会懂得我们。”　

“The great Sisler’s father was never poor and he, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age.“

“伟大的西斯勒的父亲从没穷过，他父亲在我这个年纪，一直在大联盟里打球。”

“When I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening.“

“我有你这么大的时候，上了一艘去非洲的方帆船，站在桅杆后，看到了夜晚海滩上的狮子。”

“I know. You told me.“

“我知道。你跟我讲过。”

“Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?“

“我们聊非洲还是棒球？”

“Baseball I think,“ the boy said. “Tell me about the great John J. McGraw.“ He said Jota for J.

“聊棒球吧，” 孩子说。“跟我说说伟大的约翰麦克，” 

“He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as baseball. At least he carried lists of horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the telephone.“

“他以前经常来露天酒店。但他喝了酒，很粗鲁，说话伤人，很难相处。他喜欢棒球，也喜欢赛马。他口袋里至少有一串马的名字，经常讲电话时说起马的名字。 ”

“He was a great manager,“ the boy said. “My father thinks he was the greatest.“

“他是个伟大的经理，” 孩子说。“我爸爸认为他是最厉害的。”　

“Because he came here the most times,“ the old man said. “If Durocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager.“

“因为他来这次数最多，” 老人说。“如果杜罗彻每年都来这，你爸爸也会觉得他是为厉害的经理。”

“Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?“

“谁才是真正最厉害的经理，卢克还是迈克？”

“I think they are equal.“

“我觉得他们不分上下。”

“And the best fisherman is you.“

“你是最好的渔人。”

“No. I know others better.“

“不。我知道有其他人比我更好。”

“Que va,“ the boy said. “There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you.“

“哪里，” 孩子说。“有很多好渔人，还有些非常厉害。但只有一个你。”

“Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong.“

“谢谢你。你让我很开心。我希望大鱼别来，它会证明我们错了。”

“There is no such fish if you are as strong as you say.“

“如果你像自己说的那么强壮，没有这样的鱼。”

“I may not be as strong as I think,“ the old man said. “But I know many tricks and I have resolution.“

“我可能没有自己想的那么强壮，” 老人说。“但我知道很多技巧，我还有决心。”

“You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I will take the things back to the Terrace.“

“你现在得要去床上，第二天才会神清气爽。我把东西拿回到露台酒店。”

“Good night then. I will wake you in the morning.“

“那么晚安。早上我会叫醒你。”

“You’re my alarm clock,“ the boy said.

“你是我闹钟，” 孩子说。

“Age is my alarm clock,“ the old man said. “Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?“

“年纪是我的闹钟，” 老人说。“为什么老人醒的这样早？为了天日长些吗？”

“I don’t know,“ the boy said. “All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard.“

“我不知道，” 孩子说。“我只知道小孩子睡的晚，睡的沉。”

“I can remember it,“ the old man said. “I’ll waken you in time.“

“我能记住这些，” 老人说。 “我会准时叫醒你。”

“I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior.“

“我不想他船主人来弄醒我。这样好像我比他差。”

“I know.“

“我知道。”

“Sleep well old man.“

“睡个好觉，老头子。”
