Aloud he said, "I wish I had the boy."

他自言自语，「但愿那孩子在这里。」

But you haven‘t got the boy, he thought. You have only yourself and youyou had better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils.

但是那孩子并不在这里，他想。你只有你自己，你现在最好去  弄最后那根钓丝，不管是不是在黑暗中，把它割断然后和两卷备而不用的绳子接在一起。

So he did it. It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled him down on his face and make a cut below his eye. The blood ran down his cheek a little way. But it coagulated and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the wood. He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it anchored with his shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water.

他就这么做了。在黑暗中这样做很困难，他脸朝下的时候那鱼猛力一拉，把眼睛下面划破了个扣子。血顺着他的脸颊流了一小段，但是在流到下巴之前凝固变干了，他回到船头，靠着木头休息。他调整了一下口袋，小心地弄着钓丝，把它挪到肩膀上另一个位置，然后牢固地背在肩膀上。他轻轻地感觉到鱼的拖曳，然后手可以感觉到小船在水里前进。

I wonder what he made that lurch for, he thought. The wire must have slipped on the great hill of his back. Certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does. But he cannot pull this skiff forever, no matter how great he is. Now everything is cleared a way that might make trouble and I have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask.

不知道他猛的一拉是为什么，他想。那绳索一定已经滑到了他背的凸起上。当然，他的背没我的背疼得厉害。但是他不可能永远拖着这只船走，不管他是多么大的一条鱼。现在一切能带来麻烦的。。。，我还有一卷很大的备而不用的绳子，应有尽有了。

"Fish," he said softly, aloud, "I‘ll stay with you until I am dead."

「鱼，」他轻轻地自言自语，「我会和你呆在一起，直到我死。」

He‘ll stay with me too, I suppose, the old man thought and he waited for it to be light. It was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be warm. I can do it as long as he can, he thought. And in the first light the line extended out and down into the water. The boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose it was on the old man‘s right shoulder.

他也会和我呆在一起，我想，老人一面想着，等待着天亮。天亮之前冷嗖嗖的，他靠着木头，这样暖和些。我可以一直和他这样下去，只要他可以，老人想。第一抹亮光出来的时候，钓丝往外溜出去，落入水中。小船平稳地移动着，太阳刚露出一边，钓丝压在老人的右肩上。

"He‘s headed north," the old man said. The current will have set us far to the eastward, he thought. I wish he would turn with the current. That would show that he was tiring.

「他朝着北面去了，」老人说。潮流要把我们送往东面，他想。但愿他可以转变方向，跟着潮流走。那样就说明他疲累了。

When the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring. There was only one favorable sign. The slant of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth. That did not necessarily mean that he would jump.

太阳升的更高了，老人意识到那鱼丝毫不觉得累。只有一个令人欣慰的迹象。钓丝的斜度显示他游得没那么深了。这并不一定意味着他肯跳出来。

But he might.

但也许他肯。

"God let him jump," the old man said. "I have enough line to handle him."

「上帝，让他跳出来吧，」老人说。「我的钓丝够多，应付他足够了。」
