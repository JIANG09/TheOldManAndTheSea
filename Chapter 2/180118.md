"Dolphin," the old man said aloud. "Big dolphin."

“鲯鳅，”老人大声说。“大鲯鳅。”

> 「鲯鳅，」老人自言自语。「大鲯鳅。」

He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire leader and a medium- sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of the bow. He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water.

他放下桨，从船头底下拿出一根细小的钩丝。钩丝上有一根钢丝导线，和一个中等大小的鱼钩，他拿了一条沙汀鱼穿在钩子上做饵。他让它从船边溜下去，然后迅速把它缚在船尾一只铁栓上。然后他把另一跟钩丝穿上饵，和船头那一卷卷的钩丝放在一起。他又去划船，看着长翅的黑鸟在水面低低的劳作。

> 他把桨搁下来，从船头拿出一根小钩丝。上面有一只铁丝导杆和一只不大不小的钩子，他装上一只沙汀鱼作饵。他让它在船边溜下去，然后把它缚在船尾一只铁栓上。然后把他另一根钩丝也装上饵，把它丢在那里，让它盘绕着躺在船头的阴影里。他又去划船，注视着那长翅的黑鸟，那鸟现在又在那里工作了，在水面低飞着。

As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish. The dolphin were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped. It is a big school of dolphin, he thought. They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird has no chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast.

他正看着那鸟又一次落下，掠过翅膀下降，使劲地摇摆着翅膀，也起不了什么用，他正跟着那飞鱼。老人能看见水面隆起了一点，大鲯鳅起来了，他们追逐着逃命的鱼。鲯鳅在水里前进，在逃命的飞鱼下面。这是好大一群鲯鳅，他想。鲯鳅们窃窃私语，飞鱼的机会很小。那鸟没什么机会了。飞鱼对鸟还说体型太大，而且那群鲯鳅前进的太快了。

> 他正在那里望着，那鸟又落下来了，倾斜着两翅往下飞，然后他狂乱地徒然地扇着翅膀，追逐着飞鱼。老人可以看见水面上稍稍突出一块，那是大鲯鳅掀起的波浪，鲯鳅成群地尾随着逃走的鱼。在鱼群的飞跃下，鲯鳅在下面的水里穿过，飞鱼落下来的时候适当其冲。他想这里有一大群鲯鳅。它们分布得很广，飞鱼是很少有机会逃走的。轮不到那只鸟。飞鱼太大了，他衔不住，而且它们飞得很快。

He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird. That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them. My big fish must be somewhere.

老人望着那飞鱼一次又一次迸发出水面，那鸟的移动徒劳无益。那群鲯鳅离我很远了，他想。他们前进地太快，走地太远了。但是也许我会捡到一只迷了路的，也许我的大鱼就在他们周围。我的大鱼一定在那儿。

> 他看见那飞鱼一次又一次地冲出来，和那只鸟徒劳无功的动作。这一群我捉不住它们了，他想。它们游地太快，太远。但是或者有一条落在后面，被我碰上了；也许我的大鱼就在它们附近。我的大鱼总得在那儿的。

The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple. As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish. The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land. But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating close beside the boat. It turned on its side and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.

陆地上空的云朵现在耸地和山一样高，海岸只是一根长绿的线，后面是灰蓝的小山丘。海水现在是暗蓝色的，暗的几乎是紫色了。他向水里望去，看见了黝暗的水里浮着红色的生物，还有太阳反射出奇异的光彩。他望着自己的钩丝，看见他们毕直的深入水里，直到望不见。他看到了很多海藻，感到很高兴，因为这意味着有鱼。太阳照在水里发出奇异的光，现在太阳升高了，说明天气不错，陆地上的云的样式也同样表示天气会好。但是现在几乎看不见鸟了，水面上什么都没有，但是有些太阳晒过的马尾藻，上面有黄色斑点，还有只大水母，有着紫色、胶质的、虹晕的气泡，飘在离船很近的地方，它翻过身来，然后又翻正了。它欢快地漂浮着，像一个气泡，那长长的紫色纤丝可以致命，有一码长，拖在身后的水里。

> 陆地上的云气现在堆地和山一样高，海岸只是一根长长的绿线，背后是灰蓝色的山。水现在成了深蓝色，这样深，差不多是紫的。他向水里望下去，看见黝暗的水里潜伏着红色的海藻，还有太阳反映出来的奇异的光彩。他守着他的钩丝，使它们毕直垂到水里去，直到看不见为止。他看到那么许多海藻，觉得很快乐，因为有海藻就有鱼。现在太阳高了些，太阳照在水里发出那奇异的光，是好天气的征兆，陆地上云的样式也同样地表示天气好。但是那鸟现在差不多看不见了，水面上什么都看不出，只有几摊黄色的马尾藻，被太阳晒褪了色；还有一个大水母，有着紫色的、胶质的、虹晕的气泡，它浮到船的近旁。它翻了个身，然后又坐正了，它愉快地漂浮着，像一个水泡一样，它那长长的有毒的紫须拖在它后面一码远。

"Agua mala," the man said. "You whore."

「水怪，」老人说。「你这婊子。」

From where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw the tiny fish that were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them and under the small shade the bubble made as it drifted. They were immune to its poison. But men were not and when some of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was working a fish, he would have welts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak can give. But these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash.

他在那儿轻轻的摇着桨，向水里望下去，看见些小鱼，颜色同拖曳的须一个样，它们在长须之间游着，在飘浮的气泡的小小阴影下面。它们不会中毒，可是人类就不一样；一些长须缠在钩丝上，就在上面歇着，黏滑的紫色物体，要是这时候老人正在打鱼，他的手臂上、手上都会溃疡，像是触了毒漆染上的皮疹。但是大水母的毒来的很快，就像被鞭子打了一样。

> 他轻轻地倚在桨上，向水中望去，看见那些小鱼，和那拖着的长须同一个颜色，鱼在长须中间游着，在那漂流着的气泡小小的阴影中游着。它们不会中毒的。人类就不然，有时候老人钓鱼的时候有些长须绊在一根钩丝上，就黏在上面，腻搭搭的，紫色的，他的手和手臂上就会一条条地红肿起来，就像接触了毒藤和毒橡树一样。不过这种怀水怪的毒性发作得快，像一条鞭子似地打下来。

The iridescent bubbles were beautiful. But they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating them. The turtles saw them, approached them from the front, then shut their eyes so they were completely carapace d and ate them filaments and all. The old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet.

有虹晕的气泡很美丽。但是他们是这海里最不忠实的东西，老人喜欢看大海龟吃了他们。海龟看见他们，从前方靠近，然后闭上眼睛，全部缩进龟壳里，接着一口吃了长须和大水母。老人喜欢看海龟吃了他们，他喜欢在暴风雨后的海滩上，在他们的背上走路，然后他用长满厚茧的双脚在他们背上踏步的时候，就听见他们伸出脑袋。

> 那发虹光的气泡是美丽的。但是它们是海中最虚伪的东西，老人爱看那些大海龟吃它们。那些海龟看见了他们，就迎面向它们游过来，然后把眼睛闭起来，完全缩到壳里去，吃掉他们，连长须都吃掉。老人爱看乌龟吃它们，他也喜欢在暴风雨后在海滩上践踏它们，他脚底生着老茧，脚踩上去，他爱听它们发出那迸脆的声音。

He loved green turtles and hawk-bills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid loggerheads, yellow in their armour-plating, strange in their lovemaking, and happily eating the Portuguese men-of-war with their eyes shut.

他喜欢绿海龟和玳瑁，因为他们的优雅，他们的速度和巨大的价值。他对庞大笨拙的红海龟有一种友善的轻视，他们的龟壳有些偏黄，求爱的时候很奇怪，闭着眼睛愉快地吃了大水母。

> 他爱绿色的乌龟和「鹰喙」，它们体态优雅，动作迅速，而且非常值钱。他对红海龟则有一种友善的藐视，那些呆木木的大傻瓜，动辄缩到它们的甲胄里面去，那样懦怯，它们的求爱方式又那样奇怪，它们快乐地闭着大眼睛吃着大水母。

He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years. He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton. Most people are heartless about turtles because a turtle‘s heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered. But the old man thought, I have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs. He ate the white eggs to give himself strength. He ate them all through May to be strong in September and October for the truly big fish.

> 他虽然在捕龟船上工作了许多年，他对乌龟并没有神秘的观念。他替一切乌龟干大奥难受，就连那大龟背，和这小船一样长，有一吨重，他也觉得它们可怜。大多数的人都对乌龟残酷，因为一只乌龟被屠杀开剖后，它的心还继续跳动好几个钟头。但是这老人想，我也有这样一个心，我的脚和手也像它们的。他为了滋补，给他自己长力气，他吃那白色的蛋。他五月里连吃了一个月，使他在九月十月里强壮起来，可以对付真正的大鱼。

尽管他以前捕海龟很多年了，他觉得海龟并不神秘。他为所有海龟感到惋惜，即便那巨大的树干似的龟背有小船那么长，有一吨重。大多数的人对海龟是无情的，因为即使把海龟割开宰杀了，它的心脏还会继续跳动几个小时。但是老人想，我也有这样的一颗心脏，我的手脚和它们的一样。他吃白色的蛋，为了给自己力量。整个五月份，他都吃那白蛋，就图在九月份和十月份体力强壮，足够对付真正的大鱼。

He also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of the fishermen kept their gear. It was there for all fishermen who wanted it. Most fishermen hated the taste. But it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes.

他也每天喝一杯鲨鱼肝油，很多渔夫放工具的小屋里的大桶里得来的。它就放在那儿，供给所有想要的渔人。大多数渔人都憎恶那味道。但这不比。。。。是抵御寒冷和感冒的良品，对眼睛也很好。

> 他每天还喝一杯鲨鱼肝油，许多渔夫贮藏工具的一座小屋里有一大桶鱼肝油，一切渔人要吃都可以去吃。大多数的渔人都恨那滋味。但是也不必黑早起身更坏--每天那时候都得起来--而且这鱼肝油可以抵制一切的风寒和流行感冒，对于眼睛也有益。

Now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again.

老人现在向上看去，看见那只鸟又在盘旋着。

>  现在那老人抬起头来，看见那鸟又在那里盘旋着了。
