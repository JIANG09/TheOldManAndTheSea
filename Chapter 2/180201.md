The fish never changed his course nor his direction all that night as far as the man could tell from watching the stars. It was cold after the sun went down and the old man‘s sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs. During the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry. After the sun went down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his shoulders now. The sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he was almost comfortable. The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he thought of it as almost comfortable.

那一整晚，老人望着星星，发现那鱼一直没改变路线，也没改变方向。 太阳下去了，天很冷，老人的汗在背上凝干了。白天的时候，他用口袋盖住装饵的盒子，把袋子铺开来，放在太阳下晒干。太阳落下去，他把袋子系在颈上，好让它盖遮住背，他小心地把袋子压在肩上的钓丝下面。袋子垫在钓丝下面，减轻了震动，他找到一种方法，让身体前倾抵着船头，几乎感觉舒适。事实上，他觉得差不多已经很舒适了。

> 那天晚上，整夜地，据老人观察星象所得，那条鱼从来没有改变他的路线和方向。太阳下去以后就很冷，老人的汗冰冷地在他背上干了，在他手臂上，在他衰老的腿上。装饵的盒子上盖着的一只口袋，他白天把它摊在太阳里晒干了。太阳下去以后，他把那口袋系在颈上，使它挂在他背上，他小心地把它塞到钓丝底下去，那钓丝现在绷在他肩膀上了。钓丝下面垫了个口袋，他又想出一个办法，弯着腰靠在船头上，这样他差不多可以说是很舒服了。

I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought. Not as long as keeps this up.

我不能拿他怎么样，他也不能那我怎么样，他想。如果一直这样下去，他是不能那我怎么样的。

> 我不能把他怎样，他也不能把我怎样，他想。如果他老是这样下去，他是拿我没有办法的。
　
Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked his course. The line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his shoulders. They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was not so strong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward. If I lose the glare of Havana we must be going more to the eastward, he thought. For if the fish‘s course held true I must see it for many more hours. I wonder how the base ball came out in the grand leagues today, he thought. It would be wonderful to do this with a radio. Then he thought, think of it always. Think of what you are doing. You must do nothing stupid.

有一次，他站起来，在船沿边尿了泡尿，然后观看星象，检查自己的航线。钓丝看起来像一道磷光， 从他的肩上伸进水里。他们现在移动地更缓慢了，哈瓦那的光圈看着没那么强烈了，他知道潮流一定带着他们往东去。如果我看不到哈瓦那的眩光，我们一定是更往东去了。如果那鱼游地方向对，我一定还能看到眩光几个小时。我想知道今天大联盟比赛的棒球结果，他想。要有个收音机能得到消息 ，那简直太棒了。然后他想着，经常挂在心上。想想你正在做什么。你一定不能做蠢事。

> 有一次他站起来，在船变溺了泡尿，看看星，核对他的航程。钓丝在水中像一道磷光，从他肩膀上毕直射出去。它们现在移动得比较慢，哈瓦那的红光现在不大亮了。所以他知道那潮流一定把他们带向东面去了。如果我看不见哈瓦那强烈的灯光，我们一定是更往东走了，他想。因为假使这鱼的路线始终不变，我应当还有好几个钟头都可以看见那亮光。不知道今天棒球大联盟的结果怎样，他想。如果打鱼能够带一个收音机，那该多好。然后他想，应该永远想着这桩事，想着你眼前所做的事。千万不要做出愚蠢的事来。

Then he said aloud, "I wish I had the boy. To help me and to see this."

接着他自言自语，「要是那孩子在就好了。可以帮我看着点这个。」

> 然后他自言自语，「但愿我有那孩子在这里。可以帮我的忙，也可以让他见识见识这个。」

No one should be alone in their old age, he thought. But it is unavoidable. I must remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong. Remember, no matter how little you want to, that you must eat him in the morning. Remember, he said to himself.

年纪大的人，不应当独自一人，他想。但这是没办法的事。我必须记得吃了鲔鱼，在。。。为了保持强壮。记住，不管你怎样不愿意，你必须早晨吃了他。要记得，他对自己说。

> 一个人年老的时候不应当孤独，他想。但这是无法避免的。我一定要记着吃那条鲔鱼，在他腐烂之前吃掉他，吃了张力气。你记着，无论你怎样不想吃，早上一定要吃他。记着，他对自己说。

During the night two porpoises came around the boat and he could hear them rolling and blowing. He could tell the difference between the blowing noise the male made and the sighing blow of the female.

夜晚，两只鼠海豚靠近了小船，他可以听见他们翻滚着，喷着气。他可以分辨出，雄性鼠海豚喷气声是喧闹的，和雌性是叹息般的。

> 夜里有两只海豚到船边来，他可以听见他们在那里打滚，喷水。他可以听得出雌雄的分别，雄的喷水的声音和雌的叹息似的喷水声。

"They are good," he said. "They play and make jokes and love one another. They are our brothers like the flying fish."

「他们真好，」他说。「他们玩耍，玩笑，爱着彼此。他们和飞鱼一样，是我们的友伴。」

> 「它们是好样的，」他说。「它们玩耍，讲笑话，彼此相爱。它们也和飞鱼一样，都是我们的兄弟。」

Then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked. He is wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is, he thought. Never have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely. Perhaps he is too wise to jump. He could ruin me by jumping or by a wild rush. But perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his fight. He cannot know that it is only one man against him, nor that it is an old man. But what a great fish he is and what will be bring in the market if the flesh is good. He took the bait like a male and he pulls like a male and his fight has no panic in it. I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as desperate as I am?

然后他开始惋惜他钩住的这条大鱼。他想，他是奇妙的、古怪的，谁知道他年纪有多大呢。我从来没见过有鱼这么强壮，行动这样古怪。也许是他太聪明，不肯跳起来。要是他跳起来，或者野蛮地冲向我，那我就糟糕了。但是可能他之前屡次上钩，所以清楚应该如何战斗。他不会知道只有一个对手在和他对抗，也不知道还是个老头子。不过他真是一条了不起的鱼，要是肉好的话，拿到市场上去可以卖多少钱啊！他吃饵的动作像一条雄鱼，拖曳的本领也像个雄的，在战斗里，他丝毫不慌张。我在想他是究竟有什么计划么？还是像我一样地准备拼命？

>然后他开始怜悯他钓着的这条大鱼。他想，他是奇妙的，古怪的，谁知道他年纪有多么大了。我从来没钓着过一条鱼力气有这样大，也从来没有一条鱼行动这样奇异。也许他太聪明了，他不肯跳起来。他如果跳起来，或者疯狂地冲过来，我就糟糕了。但是他也许从前屡次上过钩，他知道应当用这个办法来抵抗。他当然不知道他的敌人只是一个人，而且是一个老头子。但是他是个多么伟大的鱼啊，假使他的肉好，在市场上该卖多少钱！他吞饵的作风像一条雄鱼，他拖曳的本领也像一条雄的，他在战斗中也没有表示惊恐。不知道他究竟可有什么计划，还是他和我一样地准备拼命？
