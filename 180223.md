The old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held his hand up against the sun. It was only a line burn that had cut his flesh. But it was in the working part of his hand. He knew he would need his hands before this was over and he did not like to be cut before it started.

老人本想把手浸在海水里更久一些，但是他担心鱼又突然耸动，他直起身子，坐好，举起一只手挡住太阳光。只有一根线割破了他的。。但是在他手的工作部位。他知道他需要双手一起工作，这阵子结束之前都需要，但是他不想被割破。

> 老人很愿意把他的手在那盐水中多浸一会，但是他怕那鱼突然再歪一歪，他站起身，打起精神，把手举起来再太阳里晒着。不过是绳子勒在手心里，把肉割破了。但是正是手上最得用的地方。他知道在这件事结束之前他都会需要他的手，现在事情还没开始倒已经把手割破了，他很不高兴。

“Now,” he said, when his hand had dried, “I must eat the small tuna. I can reach him with the gaff and eat him here in comfort.”

「现在，」他说，当他的手晒干了，「我一定要吃了那条小鲔鱼。我可以用杆子够到他，然后舒舒服服地吃了他。」

> 「现在，」他的手干了以后，他说，「我得要吃那小鲔鱼。我可以用鱼钩把他钩过来，在这里舒舒服服地吃。」

He knelt down and found the tuna under the stem with the gaff and drew it toward him keeping it clear of the coiled lines. Holding the line with his left shoulder again, and bracing on his left hand and arm, he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back in place. He put one knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to the tail. They were wedge-shaped strips and he cut them from next to the back bone down to the edge of the belly. When he had cut six strips he spread them out on the wood of the bow, wiped his knife on his trousers, and lifted the carcass of the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard.

他跪下，在鱼竿下找到那鲔鱼，然后把一面把他往自己这边钩过来，一面避免碰到那一卷卷的钓丝。他又用左边肩膀绷紧钓丝，用左手和手臂拿的稳稳当当，把鲔鱼从鱼竿钩子上拿下来，然后把鱼竿放回原处。他一只膝盖压住那鱼，从鱼头的背面到鱼尾，切出一条条深红色的鱼肉。切下的鱼肉是楔形的，从那鱼的脊骨底附近到鱼肚子边缘切下来。当切下6条鱼肉时，他把他们铺船头的木头上，把刀在裤子上擦了擦，然后把鲣鱼的残体从尾巴那吊起来，放到海里。
