Now that he had seen him once, he could picture the fish swimming in the water with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the dark. I wonder how much he sees at that depth, the old man thought. His eye is huge and a horse, with much less eye, can see in the dark. Once I could see quite well in the dark. Not in the absolute dark. But almost as a cat sees.

现在他已经见过那鱼一次了，他可以描绘出那鱼在水中，用那一对像翅膀一样阔的紫色胸鳍游动着，笔直的大尾巴划破黑暗。不知道在那个深度他能看见多少，老人想。他的眼睛很大，马的眼睛比他小很多，就可以在黑暗中看得清楚。曾经，我也能在黑暗中看得清清楚楚。当然不是说绝对的漆黑。但是差不多和猫一样，看得清楚。

> 现在他既然看见过他一次，他可以想像那鱼在水里游着，他紫色的胸鳍大大地张开来，像翅膀一样，那竖直的大尾巴切坡了黑暗。不知道他在那深水里看东西可看得清楚，老人想。他的眼睛非常大，马的眼睛小得多，马在黑暗中看得见东西。从前我在黑暗中也看得相当清楚。不是完全黑暗。但是差不多像一只猫一样。
The sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now completely and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrugged the muscles of his back to shift the hurt of the cord a little.

太阳晒着，他平稳地活动手指，左手现在已经完全不抽筋了，他开始把更多压力移到左手上，他耸耸背脊上的肌肉，挪了挪绳子，疼痛的地方也移了一点。

> 他的左手又给太阳晒着，他又不停地活动着手指，现在不完全抽筋了，他开始把重量挪些到左手上；他耸耸肩膀，牵动背上的筋脉，使那绳子溜过去一点，那痛楚也稍微换个地方。
“If you’re not tired, fish,” he said aloud, “you must be very strange.”

「鱼，假使你不疲累，」他自言自语，「那你一定很奇怪。」

> 「鱼，你如果不觉得疲倦，」他自言自语，「那是一定是非常奇异的。」

He felt very tired now and he knew the night would come soon and he tried to think of other things. He thought of the Big Leagues, to him they were the Gran Ligas, and he knew that the Yankees of New York were playing the Tigres of Detroit.

他感到非常疲倦，他直达夜晚马上就要来了，于是他开始想一些别的事情。他想起了大联盟比赛，他知道纽约的洋基队和底特律色老虎队在那里比赛。

> 他现在觉得非常疲倦，他知道天就要黑了，他试着想别的事。他想到棒球大联赛，他知道纽约的洋基队和底特律的虎队在那里比赛。
This is the second day now that I do not know the result of the juegos, he thought. But I must have confidence and I must be worthy of the great DiMaggio who does all things perfectly even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel. What is a bone spur? he asked himself. Un espuela de hueso. We do not have them. Can it be as painful as the spur of a fighting cock in one’s heel? I do not think I could endure that or the loss of the eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks do. Man is not much beside the great birds and beasts. Still I would rather be that beast down there in the darkness of the sea.

现在已经是第二天了，我还不知道比赛结果，他想。但是我必须有信心，我一定相信伟大的迪马吉奥，即使他脚跟的骨刺疼痛不已，他还是可以完美地应对一切。骨刺是什么？他问自己。我们没有骨刺。我觉得，我是不能忍受那样的疼痛的，我也无法忍受失去一只或者两只眼睛，然后继续战斗。人和那些大鸟和野兽不一样。我倒愿意是那只在深暗的海里的野兽。

> 我不知道那场比赛的结果，这已经是第二天了。但是我一定要有信心，我一定要对得起那伟大的狄玛奇奥，他就连现在脚后跟骨头突了一块出来，痛得那样厉害，他仍旧是无论做什么事都是完美的。骨头突了一块出来是什么？他问他自己。骨头突了一块。我们没有这样的毛病。脚后跟痛，可会像斗鸡时装在公鸡脚上的铁钜戳进人的脚后跟一样疼痛？我恐怕是受不了这个，我恐怕不能够像公鸡一样，失掉一只眼睛或是两只眼睛，还继续战斗。人类比起那些伟大的鸟兽来是不算什么。我还是情愿做这水底下，这黑暗的海中的这条鱼。
“Unless sharks come,” he said aloud. “If sharks come, God pity him and me.”

「除非鲨鱼来，」他自言自语。「假使鲨鱼来了，上帝怜悯他，也怜悯我。」

> 「除非有鲨鱼来，」他自言自语。「要是有鲨鱼来，上帝可怜他和我，我们俩都完了。」

Do you believe the great DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I will stay with this one? he thought. I am sure he would and more since he is young and strong. Also his father was a fisherman. But would the bone spur hurt him too much?

你相信伟大的狄玛奇奥会一直和一条鱼呆在一起吗？就像我一直和这鱼呆着一样，他想。我相信他会的，因为他年轻，而且强壮。他的父亲也是个渔人。但是骨头上突了一块，他会不会感觉太痛了？

> 你可以相信那伟大的狄玛奇奥会守着一条鱼，熬这样久，他像我一样？他想。我确信他会，而且他既然年轻力壮，一定还可以熬的更久。而且他的父亲从前是个渔人。但是脚后跟骨头突了一块出来可会太痛苦？
“I do not know,” he said aloud. “I never had a bone spur.”

「我不知道，」他自言自语。「骨头上突了一块，我没有这样的毛病。」

> 「我不知道，」他自言自语。「我从来没有过这毛病。」
As the sun set he remembered, to give himself more confidence, the time in the tavern at Casablanca when he had played the hand game with the great negro from Cienfuegos who was the strongest man on the docks. They had gone one day and one night with their elbows on a chalk line on the table and their forearms straight up andtheir hands gripped tight. Each one was trying to force the other’s hand down onto the table. There was much betting and people went in and out of the room under the kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the negro and at the negro’s face. They changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees could sleep. Blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negro’s hands and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched. The walls were painted bright blue and were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows against them. The negro’s shadow was huge and it moved on the wall as the breeze moved the lamps.

为了给自己更多信心，太阳落山的时候，他记起在卡萨布兰卡酒馆的时候，他和厉害的黑人玩扳手游戏，是码头上最强壮的人。他们玩了一天一夜，手肘放在桌子用粉笔画的线上，前臂直立，手紧紧握住。每一个人都使劲将另一个人的手扳倒在桌子上。很多人都在打赌，煤油灯下，人们进进出出，他看着黑人的手臂，手还有黑人的脸。最初的八个钟头后，他们每四个小时换一个裁判，这样裁判可以睡一会。血从他和黑人的手指甲里渗出来，他们盯着对方的眼睛，看着对方的手和手臂，打赌的人一会儿进，一会儿出，坐在靠墙的高椅子上观看。墙是用木头做的，刷成宝蓝色，油灯把他们的影子投在他们自己身上。黑人的影子非常大，在墙上晃动，微风吹起，油灯摇动起来。

> 太阳落下去的时候，他为了鼓励自己，又想起那次在卡萨布兰卡的酒店里，他和那魁梧的黑人比手劲，那黑人是从琪安弗尤哥斯来的，是码头上力气最大的人。他们有一天一夜把肘弯搁在桌上粉笔划的一道线上，前臂直竖起来，两人的手紧紧交握着。每人都试着把另一个人的手压到桌上去。许多人在旁边赌东道，在那煤油灯光下，人们在房间里走出走进，他望着那黑人的手与手臂，也望着那黑人的脸。在最初的八个钟头以后，他们每四小时换一个裁判员，好让裁判睡觉。血从他的指甲和那黑人的指甲下渗出来了，他们俩向对方的眼睛里望着，也望着他们的手和手臂；赌东道的人在房间里走出走进，坐在靠墙的高椅上旁观。墙上漆着鲜明的蓝色，是木头的墙，灯把人影映到墙上。那黑人的影子非常大，微风吹动着灯盏，那影子便在墙上移动着。

The odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and lighted cigarettes for him.

一整晚，一会他赢，一会黑人赢，他们给那黑人朗姆酒喝，还给他把烟点上。

> 整夜地，打赌的比例来回变换着，他们喂那黑人吃甜酒，又给他点上香烟。
Then the negro, after the rum, would try for a tremendous effort and once he had the old man, who was not an old man then but was Santiago El Campeon, nearly three inches off balance. But the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again. He was sure then that he had the negro, who was a fine man and a great athlete, beaten. And at daylight when the bettors were asking that it be called a draw and the referee was shaking his head, he had unleashed his effort and forced the hand of the negro down and down until it rested on the wood. The match had started on a Sunday morning and ended on a Monday morning. Many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they had to go to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the Havana Coal Company. Otherwise everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish. But he had finished it anyway and before anyone had to go to work.

那黑人喝了甜酒后，使出巨大的力气，几乎将老人的手压下去三尺。那时老人还不老，叫做圣地艾哥。。。但是老人将手立起来，再一次保持均衡。他确信能打败这个黑人，这黑人是一个不错的人，是个很不错的运动员。白天，赌东道的人都想要个平局的时候，裁判摇了摇头，他释放出全身力气，将黑人的手压下去，压下去，直到把那手压在木头上。比赛是在一个星期天的早上，结束时，已经是星期一的早上了。许多赌东道的人都想要一个平局，因为他们要回码头工作，去装载糖袋，或去哈瓦那煤公司工作。否则每个人都想这场比赛有个了断，但是他还是结束了这场比赛，在任何人工作之前有了个了断。

> 那黑人吃过甜酒以后，尝试着做最大的努力，有一次他把那老人--那时候还不是个老人，而是冠军山蒂埃戈--差不多扳下来三吋。但是老人又把他的手举起来，举到完全平均的地位。那时候他就确定他可以打败这黑人--这黑人也是个好人，一个伟大的运动家。天明以后，打赌的人正在要求说就算是不分胜负，裁判员正在那里摇头，老人突然使出力气来，把那黑人的手一点一点压下去，一直压到那木头上。比赛是在一个星期日早晨开始的，在星期一早晨才结束。许多赌东道的人要求算是不分胜负，因为他们要到码头上去工作，搬运一袋袋的糖，或是到哈瓦那煤公司去工作。否则每一个人都要他们比赛下去，到结束为止。但是无论如何；他又把它结束了，而且也没有耽误任何人上工。

For a long time after that everyone had called him The Champion and there had been a return match in the spring. But not much money was bet and he had won it quite easily since he had broken the confidence of the negro from Cienfuegos in the first match. After that he had a few matches and then no more. He decided that he could beat anyone if he wanted to badly enough and he decided that it was bad for his right hand for fishing. He had tried a few practice matches with his left hand. But his left hand had always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it to do and he did not trust it.

那次过后，很长一段时间，人人都叫他冠军，接着春天还有一场返场比赛。但是下注的钱不多，他赢地非常轻松，因为他在第一回比赛就打破了琪安弗尤哥斯黑人的信心。在那之后，他有过几次比赛，就再没比过了。他确信如果他确实想要赢的话，他可以打败任何人，这对捕鱼的右手是没有好处的。他试了几次用左手比赛。但是他的左手总是背叛他，不听他的使唤，他也就不相信左手了。

> 在这以后有很长久的时候，人人都叫他冠军，在那年春天又重新赛过一次。但是打赌的注子不大，他很容易地的就赢了，因为他在第一次比赛里已经破坏了那安弗尤哥斯的黑人的自信心。在那次之后，他比赛过寥寥几次，此后就没有再赛过。他相信他如果迫切需要的话，他可以打败任何人；他认为这种角力会伤害他的右手，不利于打鱼。他曾经试过几次用左手练习角力。但是他的左手永远是一个叛徒，不听指挥，他不信任它。
The sun will bake it out well now, he thought. It should not cramp on me again unless it gets too cold in the night. I wonder what this night will bring.

现在太阳可以好好地晒一晒左手了，他想。除非到了晚上特别冷的时候，左手不会再一次抽筋了。我在想今晚会带来些什么事。

> 现在这太阳会把它烤透了，他想。它不会再抽筋了，除非晚上太冷，不知道今天晚上会有什么事发生。
An airplane passed overhead on its course to Miami and he watched its shadow scaring up the schools of flying fish.

一架去往迈阿密的飞机从头顶上掠过，他看到飞机的影子吓坏了一群群的飞鱼。

> 一架飞机在头上飞过，循着它的路线向迈阿米飞去，他看着它的影子惊起一群群的飞鱼。
“With so much flying fish there should be dolphin,” he said, and leaned back on the line to see if it was possible to gain any on his fish. But he could not and it stayed at the hardness and water-drop shivering that preceded breaking. The boat moved ahead slowly and he watched the airplane until he could no longer see it.

「既然有这么多的飞鱼，应该有鲯鳅」他说，然后背着钓丝身子向后倾，看看是否可能加重那鱼的负担。但是他不能，钓丝仍然坚硬，发出水滴般的颤动，这些都是绳子断开前的。。。小船慢慢地前进着，他望着那飞机，一直到再也看不见。

> 「有这么许多非鱼，这里应当有鲯鳅，」他说。他拉着钓丝向后仰着，看他可能够收回一些绳子，把那鱼拖过来些。但是不能够，钓丝仍旧绷得很硬，抖出一滴滴的水，就快要迸断了。船缓缓地前进，他望着那飞机，直到看不见为止。
It must be very strange in an airplane, he thought. I wonder what the sea looks like from that height? They should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high. I would like to fly very slowly at two hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above. In the turtle boats I was in the cross-trees of the mast-head and even at that height I saw much. The dolphin look greener from there and you can see their stripes and their purple spots and you can see all of the school as they swim. Why is it that all the fast-moving fish of the dark current have purple backs and usually purple stripes or spots? The dolphin looks green of course because he is really golden. But when he comes to feed, truly hungry, purple stripes show on his sides as on a marlin. Can it be anger, or the greater speed he makes that brings them out?

在飞机的感觉一定很奇怪，他想。在那样的高度上，看到的大海会是什么怎样的？假使他们飞得不太高，他们应该是能清楚地看见鱼。我想在两百噚高的空中非常缓慢地飞着，从那上面看着鱼。和捕龟船一起时，我在桅杆顶的横杆上，即便在那个高度，就能看到很多。从那儿看，鲯鳅更加碧绿，你能看见他们身上的条纹和紫色的斑点，他们游起来时，你能看见一整群鲯鳅。所有在深暗水流中游得快的鱼都有着紫色的背脊，通常还有紫色的条纹或斑点，这是为什么呢？鲯鳅看起来是绿色，当然了，因为他实在是呈金黄色。但是当他进食的时候，那时他真的饿了，他两侧出现了和马林鱼一样的紫色条纹。这是由于生气？或者是他游得更快，才显现了紫色条纹？

> 坐在飞机里一定非常奇怪，他想。不知道从那么高望下来，海是什么样子？他们要是飞得不太高，应当看得见鱼。我很想在距海二百噚高的空中慢慢飞，从高处来看鱼。在捕龟的船上，我爬到桅顶的橫桁上，就连在那样的高度上我也看到很多。从那里望下来，鲯鳅的颜色绿得多，你可以看见它们的条纹和它们的紫色斑点，你可以看见它们整个的一群在那里游着。为什么深谙的水水流里一切游得快的鱼都是紫色背脊，而且常常有紫色条纹和斑点？当然，鲯鳅看上去是绿的，因为它其实是金色的。但是有时候它真的饥饿得厉害，来吃东西，他身体两旁也现出紫色条纹，就像马林鱼一样。可会是因为愤怒，还是游得太快，所以发出这样的斑纹？

Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. It jumped again and again in the acrobatics of its fear and he worked his way back to the stern and crouching and holding the big line with his right hand and arm, he pulled the dolphin in with his left hand, stepping on the gained line each time with his bare left foot.When the fish was at the stem, plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation, the old man leaned over the stern and lifted the burnished gold fish with its purple spots over the stem. Its jaws were working convulsively in quick bites against the hook and it pounded the bottom of the skiff with its long flat body, its tail and its head until he clubbed it across the shining golden head until it shivered and was still.

那鱼被拉到船头边时，绝望地向下蹿，老人身子前倾，越过船尾边沿，拉起金光闪闪有紫色斑点的鱼，越过船沿。它的下巴正在痉挛，因为吃那钩子吃得太快，它扁长的身体，尾巴还有脑袋重重地落在船底，老人用木棒击打闪着金光的脑袋，直到它颤动了一下然后一动不动。就在天黑之前，。。经过一座大岛，马尾藻在浅海里起伏摇曳，好像大海在和黄色毯子底下的某个东西亲密，一只鲯鳅咬住了一根小绳。它跳到空中的时候，他一眼看见，它在太阳的余晖下金光闪闪，在空气中弯曲着，猛地拍打着身体。它一次又一次地跳到空中，。。。他挪到船尾，蜷着身体，用右臂和右手握住大的那根钓丝，用左手去拉鲯鳅，每次都赤着左脚踩着上钩的那根钓丝。

> 正在天黑以前，他们正经过一大摊马尾藻，多得像个岛屿似的，在那轻快的海中动荡不已，仿佛那海洋像一条黄毯子底下和什么东西恋爱着；这时候他那根小钓丝钓着一条鲯鳅。他第一次看见它，是它跳到空中，在最后的阳光中它是纯金色，曲着身子，疯狂地在空中煽动着。由于恐惧，它跳了一次又一次，像卖艺者似地表演着；他设法挪到船尾去，蹲踞着，用右手和右臂握住那根大钓丝，用左手把那鲯鳅拖进来，每次收回一段绳子，就用他赤裸的左脚踏住它。鱼在船尾绝望地跳掷着，斜打着，老人俯身凑到船尾上把那鱼从船尾拾过来，那滑泽的金色的鱼，有紫色的斑点。它的嘴抽搐地一动一动，迅速地咬着钩子，它用它那长而扁的身体和它那尾巴和头来敲打着船底，老人用木棒在那光亮的金色的头上打了一下，它方才颤抖着，不动了。
The old man unhooked the fish, re-baited the line with another sardine and tossed it over. Then he worked his way slowly back to the bow. He washed his left hand and wiped it on his trousers. Then he shifted the heavy line from his right hand to his left and washed his right hand in the sea while he watched the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the big cord.

老人从钩子上把鱼拿下来，用另外一条沙汀鱼重新装上饵，然后抛进海里。他慢慢地挪到船头，洗了洗左手，在袴子上擦了擦。然后换左手握着那根粗绳子，一边在海水里洗了洗右手，一边望着太阳落下去，看了看粗绳子的斜度。

> 老人把钩子从鱼嘴里拔出来，重新装上一条沙汀鱼作饵，把钓丝抛出去。然后他缓缓地设法挪到船头上。他洗了左手，在袴子上擦了擦。然后把那根沉重的钓丝从右手挪到左手，把右手在海里洗了一洗，他一面看着那太阳沉入海洋中，一面也看着那粗绳子的斜度。

“He hasn’t changed at all,” he said. But watching the movement of the water against his hand he noted that it was perceptibly slower.

「他一点都没变，」他说，但是望着海水来回击打着手，他发现，这鱼明显慢了下来。

> 「他完全没有改变，」他说。但是他看着那水冲激在他手上，他看得出来那鱼是慢得多了。
“I’ll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night,” he said. “He’s good for the night and so am I.”

「我要把船头这两只桨捆起来，这样在晚上可以让它慢下来，」他说。「夜里他厉害着呢，我也一样厉害。」

> 「我来把两只桨叠在一起，横绑在船尾上，这样他夜里一定要慢下来了。」他说。「他能够熬夜，我也能够。」
