He remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin. The male fish always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish, the female, made a wild, panic-stricken, despairing fight that soon exhausted her, and all the time the male had stayed with her, crossing the line and circling with her on the surface. He had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape. When the old man had gaffed her and clubbed her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and clubbing her across the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then, with the boy‘s aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat.

他记得有一次他钩住了一对马林鱼的一只。雄鱼总让雌鱼先吃，接着一只上了钩--那只雌的--她野蛮地、惊慌失措地、拼命地挣扎着，很快就精疲力尽了。雄马林鱼始终和她一起，越过钓丝，在水面上同她一起旋转。他和雌鱼隔得如此的近，老人担心他的尾巴会把钓丝隔断，他那尾巴和大镰刀一样锋利，一样大小。老人用鱼叉叉住她，打她，用砂纸边缘。。。击打她的头部，直到她的颜色几乎变得和镜子背衬的颜色一样，然后在那孩子的帮助下，用绳索把她吊了起来，那雄鱼一直在船边游着。

> 他记得那次他钓着一对马林鱼中的一条。雄鱼总让雌鱼先吃，那上钩的鱼——一条雌的——疯狂地，惊慌失措地，绝望地挣扎着，不久就精疲力尽了，那雄的一直和她在一起，他在钓丝上面游过去，陪着她一同在水面上转圈子。他离她那样近，老人很怕他会用尾巴奖钓丝斩断，他那尾巴尖利得像镰刀一样，大小和样式也像镰刀。老人用鱼钩来钩她，用木棒打她，她那长唇像一把剑似的，边缘上粗糙的像砂纸，他握住那嘴，用木棒打她的头顶，打得她的颜色差不多变成镜子背面的颜色，然后，由孩子在旁边帮助着，把她拖到船上来，雄鱼仍旧在船边游着。

Then, while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, the male fish jumped high into the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep, his lavender wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing. He was beautiful, the old man remembered, and he had stayed.

然后，老人清理钓丝，准备鱼叉，雄鱼在船边高高地跳到空中，为了看看雌鱼在那里，接着游到深处，那薰衣草色的翅膀--他的胸鳍，平铺开来，能看到宽宽的薰衣草条纹。他是美丽的，老人记得，而他一直在旁边。

> 然后，老人正把钓丝除下来，把鱼叉装上柄，那雄鱼在船边高高地跳到空中，为了要看看那雌鱼在那里，然后他张开他的淡紫色翅膀——那是他的胸鳍——一条条淡紫色阔条纹全看得见。他到深海中去了。他是美丽的，老人记得，而他一直在旁边。

That was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the old man thought. The boy was sad too and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly.

这是我见过的鱼类最悲伤的事情，老人想。那孩子也悲哀，我们再次请求她的原谅，然后宰割了他。

> 这是我在鱼类之间所看见的最悲哀的一件事了，老人想。孩子也悲哀，我们请她原谅我们，随机宰割了她。

"I wish the boy was here," he said aloud and settled himself against the rounded planks of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across his shoulders moving steadily toward whatever he had chosen.

「我希望那孩子也在这儿，」 他自言自语，然后坐在船头的圆形木板上，透过扛在肩上的钓丝，他感觉到大鱼的力量，那鱼正朝着他想去的任何方向平稳地前进着。

> 「但愿那孩子在这里，」他自言自语，他靠在船头刨圆的木板上，从他肩膀上背着的钓丝上他可以感到那大鱼的力量，那一股子劲是稳定地朝他拣定的目标移去。

When once, through my treachery, it had been necessary to him to make a choice, the old man thought.

他一旦上了我的当以后，就不得不选择一个办法，老人想。

> 他一旦上了我的当以后，就不得不选择一个办法，老人想。

His choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and traps and treacheries. My choice was to go there to find him beyond all people. Beyond all people in the world. Now we are joined together and have been since noon. And no one to help either one of us.

他选择呆在又深又黑的海水中，远远的躲开所有的陷阱、圈套和诡计。我选择去那把他找出来，去那没人去的地方。现在我们遇到一起了，自从中午我们就遇到一起了。没人帮助我，也没人帮助他。

> 他挑选居留在辽远的黑暗的深水里，没有罗网陷阱和欺诈的地方。我挑选到人迹不到的地方去找到他。现在我们遇在一起了，自从正午起就遇在一起了。我是没有一个人帮助我，他也没有一个人帮助他。

Perhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought. But that was the thing that I was born for. I must surely remember to eat the tuna after it gets light.

也许我不该做一个渔夫，他想。但我是注定为这件事而生的。我必须记得天亮时吃掉那鲔鱼。

> 也许当初我不该做一个渔夫，他想。但是我是注定为这件事而生的。天亮以后我一定要记着吃那条鲔鱼。

Some time before daylight something took one of the baits that were behind him. He heard the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff. In the darkness he loosened his sheath knife and taking all the strain of the fish on his left shoulder he leaned back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale. Then he cut the other line closest to him and in the dark made the loose ends of the reserve coils fast. He worked skillfully with the one hand and put his foot on the coils to hold them as he drew his knots tight. Now he had six reserve coils of line. There were two from each bait he had severed and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all connected.

离天亮还有点时候，有个什么东西吞吃了他后面的一只饵。他听到杆子折断了，钓丝开始从船舷上缘突然往下滑。在黑暗中，他松开了鞘刀，身子向后靠，把拉鱼的所有压力全部放在左肩上，他割断倚在船缘上的钓丝。然后割断另一根离得最近的钓丝，在黑暗里将打好结的两卷备用绳子松开。他一只手很娴熟地工作着，打结的时候，双脚踩着绳子，将他们拉紧。现在他有六跟备用的绳子了。有两根连着正在用的饵，另外两根连着已经被吃了的饵，所有的绳子都是连在一起的。

> 离天亮还有点时候，有个什么东西吞吃了他后面的一只饵。他听见那木杆折断了，那钓丝开始在船舷上飞快地往外溜。他在黑暗中解开他那插在鞘里的小刀，他将那大鱼所有的重量都压在他的左肩上，身体向后仰，就着船舷的木头上把那钓丝割断了。离他最近的一根钓丝他也割断了，在黑暗中他把备而不用的两卷绳子松着的一头系牢了。他只用一只手，巧妙地工作着，他打结的时候把一只脚踏牢在绳子上。现在他有六卷绳子预备在这里。他切断的每一个饵上有两卷，被鱼吞了的饵上也有两卷，这些绳子全接在一起了。

After it is light, he thought, I will work back to the forty-fathom bait and cut it away too and link up the reserve coils. I will have lost two hundred fathoms of good Catalan cardel and the hooks and leaders. That can be replaced. But who replaces this fish if I hook some fish and it cuts him off? I don‘t know what that fish was that took the bait just now. It could have been a marlin or a broadbill or a shark. I never felt him. I had to get rid of him too fast.

他想，天亮之后我就去弄那个40 噚深的饵，把它也切断，然后把备饵不用的绳子接起来。我会失去两百噚的卡塔兰吊索，还有钩子和走向。那可以被替代。但要是我钩住了一条鱼，把它切断了，谁可以替代这条鱼呢？我不知道那条刚刚吞了饵的鱼是什么。他可能是一条马林鱼，或者剑鱼，或者一条鲨鱼。我从没感觉到他。我必须要避免他游得太快。

> 他想，天亮以后我来想法子往后挪，凑到那四十噚的饵那里，把它也割断了，把备而不用的两卷绳子也接起来。这么样一来，我丢了两百噚卡塔伦的好绳子，钩子和导杆。那都可以再买的。但是往哪儿再去找这条鱼？万一我钓着了别的鱼，倒让他乘机逃走了。我不知道刚才吞饵的是条什么鱼。可能是一条马林鱼或是一条阔嘴鱼，或是一条鲨鱼。我还没来得及揣摩他，就不得不把他打发走了。
