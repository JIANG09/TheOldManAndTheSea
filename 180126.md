He had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it was cutting his forehead. He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being careful not to jerk on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand. He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the bow. He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure.

他把头上的草帽往头上用力压了一压，然后他钩住了鱼。他也很渴，他跪在膝盖上，很小心免得碰到钓丝，移动到船尾的位置，可以用一只手拿到水瓶。他打开喝了一点点。然后他靠在船尾休息了一下。桅杆没有立起来，帆也没有挂起来，他坐在那儿休息，努力不去想事情，只是忍受着。

> 在他钓到这条鱼之前，他把草帽重重地往下一拉，现在他额头被那草帽割伤了。同时他也口渴，他跪下来，小心地避免猛拉那根钓丝，他尽可能地向船头爬去，伸出一只手来拿到了水瓶。他打开它，喝了点水，然后他靠在船头上休息。桅杆没有树立起来，帆也没有张挂起来，他就坐在那桅竿和帆上休息着，他努力不去思想，仅只忍受着。

Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible. That makes no difference, he thought. I can always come in on the glow from Havana. There are two more hours before the sun sets and maybe he will come up before that. If he doesn‘t maybe he will come up with the moon. If he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise. I have no cramps and I feel strong. It is he that has the hook in his mouth. But what a fish to pull like that. He must have his mouth shut tight on the wire. I wish I could see him. I with I could see him only once to know what I have against me.

然后他回头看了看，已经看不到陆地了。并没有什么两样，他想。我总是能够顺着阿瓦那的光晕会的。太阳落山之前还有两个小时，也许他会在这之前游上来。要是他没有这样做，可能他会在月亮升起的时候游上来。要是他还不游上来，也许他会在下一天日出的时候游上来。我不会痉挛，觉得强壮。他的嘴里可有个钩子。但是多么大的一条鱼啊，才能想那样扯着小船。他咬着钓丝的时候，一定是紧紧地闭着嘴。我惟愿可以看见他。我惟愿可以看到他一次，知道我的对手是什么样子的。

> 然后他回过头去看看，他发现陆地已经看不见了。这也没有关系，他想。我回去可以依照哈瓦那灯火的红光。太阳落山前还有两个钟头，也许在这之前他会浮到水面上来。假使他不，也许他会和月亮一同上来。假使他仍旧不，也许他会和太阳一同升上来。我的手脚并不抽筋，我自己觉得很强壮。是他嘴里钩着一个钩子。但是这条鱼真了不起，这样拉着船跑。他一定是紧紧地闭着嘴衔着那铁丝。我希望我能看见他。我希望我能看见他一次，至少我可以知道我的对手是什么样子。
